    <h2>The grid for the beach option the potential flow model.</h2>
       There are three grid options for the beach linked to the value of the igrid parameter in the following way
<ol>
<li> Normal (uniform) grid.
<li> Simple stretched grid.
<li> Grid with flexible refinement at the beach and bottom.
</ol>
    <h3>The flexible grid (3)</h3>
     The geometry consists of four segments
<ol>
<li> The free surface. Here a Lagrangian grid is used.
<li> Most of the slope (beach). The grid is re-stretched at each 
     time step to link the shoreline with the start of the bottom segment(no. 3)
<li> The bottom from a little landward of the toe of the slope and to the
     vertical wall. A constant partition with length dxb, projected on the 
     x-axis, is employed. The shoreward limit of the segment is defined as to 
     have a whole number of intervals dxb.  
<li> The vertical wall. The grid is re-stretched at each 
     time step to connect the surface to the bottom. The resolution is uniform 
     at each time and the number of points specified (mvert).
</ol>
    For the grids used in segment 1 and 2 a simple,piecewise linear transformation is used. The partition is made, uniformely, on an interval (0,1). The stretching is then made by mapping this interval (in z, say) ono (0,c) in x, say, by
x(0)=0, x(ak)=a, x(bk)=b, x(1)=c. for z in (0,ak) and z in (bk,c) the derivative  dx/dz is constant. Moreover dx(c)/dz is f times dx(0)/dz. For z in (ak,bk)
dx/dz varies linearely. Hence, f is the refinement ratio of the grid.
A reference grid is refined by spline interpolation and smoothened.
In the surface grid a and b are between 0 and totl (equilibrium shoreline 
position). For the beach grid o corresponds to the joint with segment 3 (the bottom) and a,b are between 0 and cslope0, that is the x-span of the segment.
At z=0 the beach grid has a resolution close to dxb.
