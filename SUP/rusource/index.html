    <h1>A BIM model for full potential flow</h1>

    This page is a documentation of a, mostly, f77 code for solving the Laplace 
    equation with a free surface.  

<h3>The formulation</h3>
   The formulation is akin to that of Dold and Peregrine (the Bristol model),
   using the Cauchy integral theorem for the complex velocity,
   but is modified in certain respects
   <ul>
    <li> Cubic splines are used for interpolating the field variables, rather 
         that high order polynomials.
    <li> The time integration is of moderately high order, but similar to that 
         of Dold and Peregrine
    <li> Instead of the secant method, higher order Gaussian quadrature are 
         used for numerical integration. The secant method may be good under 
         certain simple conditions, but is inaccurate if a rapidly varying 
         resolution is applied.
    <li> Prescribed grid refinement in space and time
    <li> The splines allows for run-up computations. Analyticity is then used 
         to connect the splines along the surface with those along the bottom. 
   </ul>
<p>
A slightly more detailed and mathematical description is found in 
<a href="BIMdes.pdf"> BIMdes.pdf </a> (source in  BIMdes.tex and BM.ps, this directory).
<h3>Main features</h3>
Features included

<ul>
<li> Full nonlinearity 
<li> Boundaries as sloping beaches or vertical walls.
<li> Fully Lagrangian coordinates for free surface, but not for bottom
<li> The shoreline is automatically tracked on a sloping beach.
<li> Initial conditions are read from files.
<li> Output of fields and time series.
<li> Post-processing tools for generation of bulk velocities and pressures.
</ul>
   <p>

        <h3> Geometry, coordinate system and grid</h3>
 In its present form the model requires a smooth bottom profile.
 The geometry is one of the following (igeo parameter in parenthesis)
   <ul>
   <li> (1) simple-shelf
   <li> (2) constant-depth
   <li> (3) file 
   <li> (4) beach <br>
            In this case there is a vertical wall at x=0, a free surface 
            extending from x=0 to the beach (totl at equilibrium).
            There is a constant depth region that is smoothly connected to 
            an inclined plane. <a href="shelfgrid.html"> A grid </a>that is refined
            at the beach is an option.  
   <li> (5) shelf
   </ul>

<h3>The input and execution</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Parameters are read in a dialogue from standard input. 
         Lines starting with !
         are recognized as comments, there are some checks on the input
         and default values are generally offered. The program is occasionally 
         modified with implications for the dialogue.
         The interface script 
        <a href="../scripdoc/geninp.txt">geninp.pe </a> 
         prepares simulations
 </ul>
    <h3> Output </h3>
      <ol>
       <li> param.dat -- file with parameters in particular format.
            In addition to the input parameters also some output parameters 
            are included.  List of selected <a href="parameters.html"> parameters </a>.
       <li> dt0 -- contains a list of all scheduled time steps. If the
            simulation is stopped not all the listed steps are used  
       <li> Runup files (data from beach region). Lower case characters 
            indicate nodal values, while upper case values obtained by 
            polynomial regression. The derivatives are with respect to 
            the enumeration coordinate (integer values at nodes).
            f is potential and s is tangential velocity along bottom.
            Accelerations have a d appended. 
            d(eta)/dx can be obtained by Y'/X' 
         <ul> 
              <li>Re: t, x, X, X', X'', y, Y, Y', Y'', f, F, F', F''
              <li>Ru: t, u, U, U', U'', v, V, V', V'', s, S, S', S''
              <li>Ra: t, ud, UD, UD', UD'', vd, VD, VD', VD'', sd, SD, SD', SD''
          </ul>
       <li> At selected intervals the the field variables are printed. 
            N is the number of time for output that corresponds to N*tper, 
            where  tper is given in param.dat. The data files are not 
            equidistant in the first column that is the horizontal
             position of the nodes.<br>
             etaN :  surface positions (xy)<br>
             xyN : total fluid circumference<br>
             uN, vN : velocities in x and y direction<br>
            utN, vtN, udN, vdN, udmN, vdmN : accelerations at current and previous time <br>
            setN, solvN : spline representation of velocity and acceleration components <br>
            fN, ftN , fdN: surface potential and derivatives<br>             
<li> max.dat: Times series with maximum surface elevation <br>
t  etmax   xmax   etgmax  etgmin  iflag<br>
where etgmax and etgmin refers to max and min at nodes.
        <li> Time series at specified grid nodes.<br>
             Not complete description.......
             files:<br> 
              tideK : Time series for the surface elevations are written
                      with 5 columns in each file numbere by K. <br>
              tideraw : Times series for a selection of fields are written.
                        For each time the lines are written as<br>
                       <br>
                          time<br>
                          x,y,u,v,ut,vt,ud,vd,f,ft      for first node<br>   
                          x,y,u,v,ut,vt,ud,vd,f,ft      for second node<br>
                            ......<br>

                 The script splitser.pe splits the tideraw into numbered
                 files tserNode, one  for each node, with columns
                 time x, y, ....          
        <li> Time series are extracted at specified, fixed, x positions.
             Apart from SEuelex and SExy2 the files are in "gphov" format 
             nx times nt
             where nx and nt are points and time steps respectively. If
             The simulation is stopped due to a breakdown test or abortion
             nt may be larger than the actual number of "rows" present.
             files: <br>
               SEuelex single column file with x-positions
               SExy two column file with x,y positions at segment 2 (beach-bed)
               ES* where * is eta, u, v  contains fields on the surface <br>
               ESusb contains tangential bottom velocity<br>
            The files may be split into separate two column "time field" files
            with Eulsplit.sh.

  <h3> Examples</h3>
  
  <h4> Solitary wave shoaling and breaking at shelf </h4>
  An example with a simulation that is smooth and easy at first, but ends
  with an plunger. The shell code is automatically extracted from a slightly
  more general system and may hence look a bit strange, at first. The essentials
  are
  <ul>
    <li> First the environt variable Geirkp should be set to /mn/sarpanitu/ansatte-u1/geirkp
    <li> The script uses two other scripts, $Geirkp/bin/fullsol and $Geirkp/laplace/soliton/expand2.pe. The first is essential, the latter is just producing a very simple geometry and format the solitary wave data for input.
    <li> The command "bash demo.sh" runs the application. Download <a href="demo.sh"> demo.sh </a>.
      <li> This should produce the folders and files in <a href="demores.tar"> demores.tar </a> which is unpacked by "tar -xz < demores.tar".
    </ul>
  <h4> Solitary wave plunging at a 5.1 deg. beach </h4>
   An example is given in <a href="runup.tar"> runup.tar </a> which is unpacked by "tar -xz < runup.tar". The stanadrd input to the program is indat, while redfak.dat and inp.* are the files read by the program. Actually the simulation was made by scripts as given above.
