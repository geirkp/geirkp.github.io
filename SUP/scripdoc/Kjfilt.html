    <h1>Program for sea surface response to bottom source.</h1>
This page is a documentation of fortran codes for reading a source field and
compute a response at the surface. It utilises the 2D or 3D Green function of 
    Kajiura. Even though the Green functions are strictly valid for uniform depth only, a variable depth may be imported as a depth matrix and invoked in a local manner. Some features of the programs may not be properly tested.
    The sources are generally
chopped at boundaries of the field, implying a localised volume loss there. 
Otherwise, the methods are generally  strictly volume conserving.

<p>
    <h1>The method</h1>
The particulars of the method is given in a separate <a href="Kajrep.pdf">
report and references therein. </a> (Not yet fully developed). 
<p>
<h3>The input and execution</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Parameters are read in a dialogue from standard input. 
         Lines starting with !
         are recognized as comments, there are some checks on the input
         and default values are generally offered. 
     <li> A file in gphov format, or as a two column file, for the bottom surce (x and y) 
       must be provided. In the new version and the 2D  also a depth matrix,
       a positon file,          and a velocity file may be provided.
          For the 3D program this may correspond to either a cartesian field or a geographical one.
      <li> Corresponding output-files are produced.
    </ul>

    <h3> Input </h3>
    <h4> New version</h4>

    program, see authentic file in link below.)
    <pre>
!give type of coordinates/cartesian/

!give source alternative
moving # alternatives: fixsor, moving
!give position file
xpos # only if moving
!give velocity file
uslide # may seem redundant, but really defines a strengtyh factor for source.
 !give truncation limit over depth/   5.0000000000000000      /
 $blf # distance/depth beyond which the source influence is set to zero. Must be positive
 !give n.o. terms in series
 $nterm # number of terms in series expansion for green function
 !give n.o. table points
  $ntab # number of points in table for Green function
 !give type of interpolation/linear/

!Give tent. inc. trans field
$resx $resy # Tentative resolution output. may be a lot courser than in
!              input source file 
!give width
$mss # give points in width
!give dipole volum/  -1.0000000000000000      /
$volnum # if input > 0 a dipole source is computed. Volume must be provided
    </pre>
    All $something represent a single value.   <br>
    Everything after # are extra comments and cannot be included in an input file.<br>
    I: For cartesian all lengths must be equally scaled: a length scale must be chosen. Naturally, that may well be the length of that prototype in Paris, but the depth and grids then must be in meter. The source strength may be scaled arbitrarely; what scaling for this
    you put in you get out. <br>
    II: for fixsor there are problems with non-zero rimwidths
    <h4> Old version</h4>

  <h3> The output</h3>
    The following output is produced
    <ol>
   <li> param.dat - parameter file
   <li> hh1 or hh2; two columns (xy). 1 is for linaer interpolation 
        2 for spline.
        The file contains the interpolation table. In the linear case this is 
         simply the values of the Green function. For spline interpolation
         it is the basic spline coefficient. In the latter case an extra value 
         is found at the end and beginning of the table and the values of the 
         Green function at point j is obtained by (v_j-1 +4*v_j+v_j+1)/6.
    <li> wf (gphov). The response to a point source.
    <li> zcord - two column with vertical grid (node-number z) 
    <li> The file (name specified in input) with the surface response.

    </ol>
    New version may in addition output:
    <ol>
      <li> dipsor - dipole source file
      <li> osor -- source without transfer function, in same format as
	transfered source.
	<li> assemb -- may correspond to the total bottom change

      Comments
      <ul>
	<li>	Dialogue may be modifed for other uses of the program.
	  <li> When plane simulations for a deformable slide are to be conveyed to GloBouss, the slide deformation rate fields must be convered into a gphov file; one line for each time. Then the output must be chosen as "field". Together with a file for times this may be imported into GloBouss.
	</ul>
      <h3> output</h3>
      <ul>
	<li> Parameter file, param.dat, with a few parameters only.
	<li> If 'strip' is specified for output a file 'eta', either two column og gphov, is
	  produced for the surface respons.
	  <li> If 'field' is specified for output a gphov file 'smC.dat' is produced for the surface respons, while a file in the same ormat are prodiuce for the bottom sources ('osor').
