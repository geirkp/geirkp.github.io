    <title>Script for restart of Boussinesq model</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="white">
    <h1>Restart and prolongation of global Boussinesq runs</h1>
     Documentation of the script ggrestart.pe that automizes a continuation
     of runs made by <a href="../scripdoc/gglparse.txt">gglparse.pe </a>. 
     <p>
    <h3> Requirements for use</h3>
     The script must be run in the directory of the mother simulation and 
     reads the parameter files param.dat (made by gglo) and 
     ggl.par (made by gglparse.pe) which must be present. Also the fields 
     (u, v and eta) of the time from which we desire a restart must be present.
     In addition the original bathymetry file of the mother simulation must be 
     available or another must be specified.  
    <h3> Parameters </h3>
      <pre>
Use:
/hom/geirkp/bouss/trappe/bin/gglrestart.pe \#DEF=<input-file> (options)
</pre>
     Essentially ggrestart.pe shares the options of gglparse.pe. Default values
     are copied from the mother simulation (through param.dat and ggl.par) and
     the parameters may be redefined through the input-file or command line 
     options. Exceptions from the copying of options are the '-run' and 
     '-compile' options that are turned off (and must be turned on explicitly 
     if they are wanted) and '-t0' for which the argument is computed from
     '-nstart'(below) and the parameters of the mother simulation. Besides, the
     '-noosc' option is employed (the mother job may already added what is 
     needed), but can be overruled a blank value in the input-file.  <br>   
     In addition three extra options are defined
     <pre>
-nstart arg: arg is the number of outprint from which a restart is made
             Default: the last dataset computed
-subdir arg: the subdirectory in which the new simulation is performed
             Default: restart$i for the lowest number $i for which no such 
             subdirectory exists ($i is maximum 9)
-trunk arg:  Set surface elevations with values less than arg to zero.
             This is imporatnt if the bathymetry is redefined
             Default: arg=-400
     </pre>
   The presedence of the parameters is as follows
   <ol>
    <li> All other settings are overruled by command-line options
    <li> The parameters set in input-file
    <li> The parameters as recomputed in ggrestart.pe (-t0 etc.)
    <li> Parmeters inherited from the mother simulations
    <li> The default values from gglparse.pe for parameters that have been
         introduced later than the mother simulation. This is to enable
         backward compatibility. 
   </ol>
