pdatpros.pe* gphov xyuv conversion


Converts a xyuv file to gphov format. Use:

/hom/geirkp/SUP/experiments/pdatpros.pe (-rotate arg) fil

parameters:
    -rotate arg : rotates data an angle arg (deg)

The other options are obselescent. The xy data are assumed to organized either
column by column or row by row and the x-axis in the gphov format is the axis
aligned closest to the physical x-axis. The increments are computed.

Produced files

 U.dat V.dat -- gphov files for the velocity components
 X.dat Y.dat -- gphov files for x and y; used for controle
 C.dat D.dat -- gphov files for rotation and divergence that are
                 computed by differences.
 param.dat -- contains parameters
