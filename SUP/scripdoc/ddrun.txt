  Script that organizes runs of the oblique, mixed Eulerian/Lagrangian run-up
  model in the ddsta program. The data are put in directories:

    A. If an Eulerian grid is used:
      -sti-input/eq/a-amp_-heln_-theta_rf-rfak'f'-f'Ll'-Llim'El'-Elim/'nf'nf
  where words preceded by - correponds to values set by options, the quoted
  strings are text constants and the following ae computed
         eq - equation type Bouss, LBouss, NLSW, LSW in outer region.
         nf - resolution 
   If the number of iterations is specified '_iit'-iit is added after -Elim.

    B. If an Eulerian grid is not used:
      -sti-input/eq/a-amp_-heln_-theta_rf-rfak/'nf'nf


-input arg : Type of incident wave
             default: sol
-nf arg : Refinements as a series of numbers separated by blanks or commas.
          In the first case the argument must be quoted.
          default: 1,2,4
-dx0 arg : Default Eulerian space increment
      default : Wavelength/20
-f arg : Fraction between Lagrangian and Eulerian space increment.

            fraction of depth. The latter is marked by an appended d. 
           default: 0.5d 
-Elim arg : Initial start of Eulerian grid. If arg > total tank length there is
            only a Lagrangian grid. May be specified by an d, such as LLim.
            The -dyn option causes points to be removed or added at the 
            shoreward end according to the motion of the Lagrangian grid.
           default: 
-Eleft arg : Absolute shoreward limitation of Eulerian grid.
        default:  -2.0
-nut arg: number of outprints
        default:  10
-t arg: Total time
       default: (In. peak p. + 2.6*(slope length))/(linear proj. cel.)
-rfak arg: reduction fator for time step
         default: left to program
-xi arg: Position (peak) of incident waves
         default: length of slope +0.5*wavelength + rimwidth 
-lambda arg : Sets wavelength. For solitary wave the formal wavelength is 
              set through -etru
              default: 1.0
-sti arg : sets path of output directory
          arg=""
-gl arg : Smoothing portion of slope
          default: 0.125
-iit arg: Number of iterations
          default: left program (depends on angle of incidence)
-dry : Runs script in dry mode. 
-brytgren arg: breaking limit for dx/da ?
            default: 0.01
-heln arg : Slope angle, specified in degrees (single number) or
            relative slope according to arg=n:m. 
            default: 15 degrees
-amp arg : amplitude of incident wave
           default:  0.1
-blockprint arg : Governs type of time-series print in gphov formatted file
              Options fixg (fixed grid), flex (stretches the rows, 
              non-uniform grid is defined through additional gphov file).
              or non
              default: non
-blockint arg arg : sets interval for blockprint with fixg (fixed grid)
              default: according to program
-blockng arg : number of points in blockprint
              default: according to program 
-jbname arg : name of jobfile
           default: ddjb.sh
-rim  arg: Standard rimwidth
           default: 0.15*wavelength
-theta arg : Angle of inclination in degrees
        default:  0.0
-L  arg : Length of flat part of wave tank.
        default: arg=(xi-length of slope)+0.5*wavelength+rimwidth

-etru : Sets truncation limit for incident solitary waves as fraction 
        of amplitude.
        default: 0.001
-hyd : Turn the outer model hydrostatic
-lin : Turn the outer model linear
-ver arg : Selects version of program 
           default: ""  
-dyn : Turns on dynamic extension of Eulerian grid.
-sync arg : Govern type of synchronization in the overlap-zone
           default: none 
-maxstop : Makes the program stop when first maximum runup is reached
-compile : Turn on compilation of the ddsta program
