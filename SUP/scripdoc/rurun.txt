Runs the knaai program in different modes.

Use:

     /hom/geirkp/lagbouss/bin/rurun.pe  (options..)

Command line arguments:
-nodefpath: flag that prevents old and often inappropriate setting of the 
            path 
-input arg: Input/start mode ar is one of
        cohat-paddle: A pulse of predefined shape is made by the paddle.
                          Amplitude and length (approximately) on produced
                          waves are read.
         file-paddle: paddle motion is read from file
         soliton-felt: initial condition is set to a solitary wave
         full-felt: initial conditions are read from files
         Catalina-slide: Benchmark 3 from Catalina meeting
    default: cohat
-n arg : set number f grid points. arg may be a list separated by commas or 
         blanks.
    default: 40 (very coarse) 
-nut arg : set the number of printing of field variables
     default: 10
-t arg : set the total simulation time
     default: time is tentatively computed and simulation is stopped at max 
              runup.
-rfak arg: maximum ratio dt/da, where da is average spatial step,
          corresponding to a Courant number. 
      default=1. Should be reduced for hydrostatic simulations
-gradd : adds rf$rfak to the folder path (after no points)
        default: no inclusion of the maximum Courant number
-l arg : Sets length of flat bottom part of wave tank. If arg is number, then
         the length is arg*wavelength. If the number is preceded by A the
         length is absolute.
      default: 0.5
-lamb arg : Wavelength, only meaningful for some simulation modes
      default 10
-spos arg : Sets distance from wall to spos for soliton-felt input.
      default: Blank argument that will center the soliton in flat region ? 
-sti arg : adds arg in the data path. Provided the -nodefpath is used
      data from simulation with 20 points then is put in arg/n20 
      default: no path
-gl arg : sets fraction of the beach, measured from junction to equilibrium 
          shoreline, that is replaced by a kind of spline to make a smooth 
           transition. A to small arg may cause noise.
      default: 0.25 (rather large)
-iit arg: number of iterations in governing equations 
     default: 5
-dry : No simulation is performed, but folders and input file is generated
-xpos arg : List of a-values to be traced  
       default: 0.05 0.15 0.45  0.9 1.3 ,
-bryt arg: Breaking criterion on dx/da
-hyd: Chooses the NLSW equation
       default: Boussinesq
-heln arg: sets the slope angle in one f the forms:
            single number - angle in degrees
            number1:number2 - a number1 in number2 slope 
-amp arg : amplitude of incident (initial) wave
            default: 0.1
-jbname arg : Sets name of shell code
             default: JBpost, where post is made up by the script
-utdata arg : which interval for which fields are to be printed.
              must be given either as digits or as text 'alle'
         default: alle
-bbd arg1 arg2 arg3: parameters that governs 
          diffusion in bbdsetstyle(-1 ... turns off diffusion) 
         default: -1 0 0,
-igdiff arg: Number of smoothings on diffusion coefficients.
         default: program default 
-ar : chooses a (more) nonlinear form for the dispersion terms
      in the  Boussinesq equations
     default: off
-reg : used with -ar to pick Boussinesq equation.
       If this flag is set, then a regular form is used, otherwise a
       form that is singular when the contact point angle is 90 deg is
       invoked.
     default : regular form
-hodisp : adds a correction term for dispersion, similar to the one used in 
          GloBouss.
     default: no correction
-randfile arg: Sets name of file for input a offshore boundary (wave paddle).
          default: urand.dat
-tser arg: sets Eulerian time series positions. 
           The prefix Blokk: indicates that the time series should be
           written as a gphov file. Otherwise an ad-hoc packed 
           format is used. Time series are set either as
           a sequence of numbers, divided by blanks or commas) or les:file
           where file contains the numbers.  
     default: no time series
-lagser arg: sets Lagrangian nodal time series positions. Time series 
          are set in the same manner as above, except 
          that the location is an integer node number.
     default: no time series
-vext arg: selects compiled version of knaai: knaai'arg'
      default: arg=.new
-dtu arg: temporal offset between initial velocities and surface 
      default: 0.0
-inpstem arg: Common prefix for initial data. Files are arg.eta
              and arg.u
      default:inp
