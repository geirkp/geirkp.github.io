Uturn.pe* velocities gphov
      Turn around a file with velocities in x-direction, un the sense that
      the first column is swapped by the last etc. With standard options
      this corresponds to a change of sign in the x coordinate.
      Also scaling and transformation may be included by setting the 
      appropriate options.
      Can automatically handle all types of gphov files.
      
      Use:
             Uturn.pe (option option ..)  file1 
      parameters:
            -o arg : output file is named arg. If the name in arg  
                     end with .bin a binary file is made.
                     default: gpdiff.dat
            -fkod arg: In case of binary output file
                        arg=d yields 64 bit floats, otherwise 32 bits are
                        used. 
                        default arg=f
            -xstretch xs: the x coordinate is stretched by xs.
                        default xs=-1
            -tstretch ts: time is stretched by ts. This affects the output 
                        velocities that are stretched by xs/ts
                        default ts=1
            -ystretch ys: the y coordinate is stretched by ys.
                        default ys=1
            -x0 arg: New lower left x.
                        default: as obtained from transformation by xs 
            -y0 arg: New lower left y.
                        default: as obtained from transformation by ys
