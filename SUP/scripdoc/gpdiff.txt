gpdiff.pe* differanser gphov
      Performs simple algebraic manipulation on  gphov files.
      Newer versions can automatically handle all types of gphov files.
      The files must have identical grids.
      Bruk:
             gpdiff.pe (option option ..)  file1 file2
      parameters:
            -o arg : output file is named arg. If the name in arg  
                     end with .bin a binary file is made.
                     default: gpdiff.dat
            -fkod arg: In case of binary output file
                        arg=d yields 64 bit floats, otherwise 32 bits are
                        used. 
                        default arg=f
            -w arg1 arg2 : The script computes arg1*a+arg2*b,
                           where a and b are values from  file1 and file2 
                           respectively. If arg1 has the special value
                           max (arg2 arbitrary, but mandatory) the script 
                           computes the maximum of a and b.
                           default: arg1=1, arg2=-1
