  /hom/geirkp/SUP/experiments/initialperf.sh

  Prepare initialization for paddle iteration. 
  The initial and final files are in
  volt, cm and seconds.
  Everything is performed within a rigid filestructure (see below) that
  is consistent with the one of initperf.sh.
  The shell is a wrapping of /hom/geirkp/SUP/experiments/lagtser.pe.

  options
         -case arg: Sets case identifier
               default arg=IV
         -depth|-dyp arg: set the depth
               default arg=0.2
         -glatt arg: Number of pointwise smoothenings used in  production
                of voltage (conveyed to lagtser.pe)
                default arg=0
         -fasit arg: name of file with the desired ("prescribed") 
                     paddle-displacement (in cm and s).  
                     default arg='wave.dat'
         -hz arg: sampling rate for output voltage
               default arg=500
 

    Filstructure:
      Starting at the current directory, where the script is run, we
      have the following folders and subfolders ($case is the case identifier)

      ./case$case/initial
        Paddle-input in file padin1$depth, parameters in param.dat
        Other subdirectories are not touched

      ./prescribed/case$case/$fasit
         contains the desired paddledisplacement as tx in file $fasit
