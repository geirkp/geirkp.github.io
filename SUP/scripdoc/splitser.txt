splitser.pe* conversion of time series


Converts a gglo output files to (time,value) files. The use of the
script requires the presence of ggl.par and param.dat in addition to
the raw time series files.
Use:

/hom/geirkp/bouss/trappe/bin/splitser.pe (-nser arg ) (-field arg)  (-oscal)

parameters:
    -nser arg : Selects which time series to extraxct.
                arg is a list of number (corresponding to *xy files) or the
                text all
                default: arg=1 
    -field arg: arg is eta, u or v and defines field to be extracted
                default: arg=eta
    -oscal : Use of this flag yields scaled output 
             (same scaling as in input til gglo)
Produced files
 spl*N for unscaled and spl*DN for scaled series. * is eta, u or v, while 
 N is the number of the time series.
