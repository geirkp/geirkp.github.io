gpmask.pe* masking gphov
      Conveys a mask from one  gphov file to another.
      The files must have identical number of points.
      If an item in file2 is less than a specified limit this is printed, 
      otherwise the item in file1 is printed. 

      Use:
             gpdiff.pe (option option ..)  file1 file2
      parameters:
            -o arg : output file is named arg. If the name in arg  
                     end with .bin a binary file is made.
                     default: gpmask.dat
            -fkod arg: In case of binary output file
                        arg=d yields 64 bit floats, otherwise 32 bits are
                        used. 
                        default arg=f
            -lim arg :  Limit for mask
                           default: arg=-500
