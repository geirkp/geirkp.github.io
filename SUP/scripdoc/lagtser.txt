 /hom/geirkp/SUP/experiments/lagtser.pe

The script produces  paddle motion  voltages for labview. unix2dos is run
on the final output. The voltage distribution includes a forward motion,
according to the input file, a period at rest and a slow backward motion to
the reference position (at 0.8V). Files produced:

  A one-column sampled dos file with voltages (name set by -o). This is the 
  input-file for labview.

  A two-column unix file with t,V. Name is the previous one, preceeded by
  an extra D. 

  Differensiated files for "voltage" velocity and acceleration. _der and
  _der2 are appended to the filename of the above t,V file.

  lagt.par is a parameter file that also contain maximum acceleration etc.

/hom/geirkp/SUP/experiments/lagtser.pe (options) inputfile

Options:
   -o arg : Name of outputfile. A file with name Darg is a two column 
            file in unix format, suited for plotting etc . 
            Default arg=pser.dat
   -depth arg : Sets the depth. If arg=set we assume that the input is in
                cm and seconds, otherwise input is assumed dimensionless with
                depth as length scale.
                Default arg=0.2
   -hz arg : Sampling rate in output. Default arg=100
   -padfile arg : arg is the name of the 'xV' file (cm and volt) that
                  defines the relation between voltage and paddle-displacement.
                  Default arg=/info/SUP/paddle/padV.x
   -rest arg : Sets rest time, before the paddle return to reference position,
               to arg seconds.
               Default arg=5
   -slfak arg : Makes time for restoring motion arg times that of first motion.
                Default arg=4
   -voltin :  makes the script assume that the input file is (time, volt) 
              rather than (time, position).
              Default: input in (time, position)
   -tshift arg : Shifts time in output by amount arg seconds.
                 Default arg=0
   -t0 arg : Uses the input time series from time=arg.
             Default arg=first time on file
   -smooth arg : Number of pointwise smoothings applied to output.
                 Default arg=0
   -reg arg:  Defines regression type for output. Possible values are lin, 
              kvad and kub, in addition to a blank argument that surpresses
              regression of any kind.
              default: arg='' 
   -ibr arg :  Half number points used in regression.
               default: arg=10 
   -vamax arg: maximum acceleration allowed, in V/s^2 calculated by a mid-point
               difference. A warning is given if this value is exceeded.
               default arg=110
   -vvmax arg: maximum velocity allowed, in V/s calculated by a mid-point
               difference. A warning is given if this value is exceeded.
               default arg=40
