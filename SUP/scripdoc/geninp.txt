 geninp.pe
       Produces input for solitary wave runup for rumain 
       (and Boussinesq ) programs. If the orientation of the solitary
       wave propagation is turned by the -reverse flag, we instead 
       simulate runup on a vertical wall.     

Parameters:
 -a a : Sets initial condition.
       a is a number starting with 0. : a is solitary wave amplitude,
       otherwise a must contain two filenames (eta and potential) separated by
        blank or comma. Normal velocity is assumed zero ?
      Default: a=0.34

           in the sense that arg*a is the smallest value to be set

       with d=0.2m
        Default: def, the time is calculated based on the parameters   
-nut arg: Number of intervals in time, followed by printing of fields
        Default: 20

-red arg: Reduction factor for time step. arg=1 will not correspond to linear
          stability limit such as for explicit LSW models.  
        Default: 1

         Default: one
-gpoint arg : Number of points for beach method for geometry
         Default: 6
-adap : Sets grid type to be adaptive
         Default: not adaptive 
-f arg: Used with -adap. Refinement at shore relative to deep water
        at t=0    
         Default: arg=0.3

         Default: 0.5
-nbouss arg: Sets number of grid points in Boussinesq-model input files. 
          Default: Left to program
-tstyle arg : Temporal resolution type. Either uniform or the name of 
              a file containing  two columns
                t1  r1
                t2  r2
                ...
              Then a relative refinement of r1 is used for t<t1. This is then
              changed linearly to r2 at t2 etc.  
          Default: uniform
-btol arg: defines tolerance for introduction of extra point at the shore 
          Default: -1.0, meaning de-activated

-reverse : Make the initial soliton  advance to decreasing x 
           Default: propagation toward increasing x
-flat arg : Length of flat part of bottom   
          Default: def; computed from parameters 
                  (soliton is centered in flat region)
-tser arg : Lagrangian time series at nodes.
             arg is either a list of numbers, separated by blanks or commas,
            or les:file, where file contains the numbers
