reorfig.pe# figures postscript latex

The point of the script is to transform a ps file with overlain text (or
other graphic elements in latex)
in a latex picture environment into a ps that incorporates the text.
The input file is a single figure with a picture environment and caption, as
generated by the pakk.pe script. First the picture part is extracted, included 
in a stripped tex environment (with pagestyle empty) and processed by latex
and dvips. A new file, corresponding to the original one, with the compiled,
integrated ps file together with the original caption.
