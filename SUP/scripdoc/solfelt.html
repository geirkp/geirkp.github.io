    <title>Script for generation of solitary wave data from full potential theory</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="white">
    <h1>solfelt.sh: solitary wave data from full potential theory</h1>
     The script utilizes <a href="../scripdoc/fullsol.txt"> fullsol</a>,
     geninp.pe through the script solrup.sh and <a href="../scripdoc/felt.txt"> felt.sh </a>.
     A simpler version that omits solrup.sh might have been an advantage. 
     <p>
    <h3>What is produced</h3>
      The script must be invoked in a folder for which the user has writing 
      privileges. An temporary sub-folder is the produced and removed, unless
      a flag is set to indicate otherwise, and a final folder with name <br>
                    $gstem$a_$n_$m                         <br>
      is made where $gstem is atag set by the user of the script, $a is the 
      amplitude and $n, $m define the resolution. 
      <ul>
<li> p,u, v : files for dynamic pressure and velocity components <br>
     full pressure is then p-y (vertical) + const.<br>
     Files are in <a href="../gpxyconv/index.html"> gphov </a> format.
<li> surf : contain surface elevations for each column in the p, u and v 
     matrices. Format is xy
<li> fullsol.par : contains output from the fullsol implementation, in 
     particular a value for the wave celerity.
<li> A set of files contain values at the nodes of the BIM simulations.
     For these data no extra interpolation is involved.
<ul>
<li> ubott: a two column file with x,u at the bottom
<li> ubspcoff: a one column file with cubic B spline coeffcients for u at the bottom. Note: this file contains the extra coeff. at the boundaries.
<li> uv*surf and uv*bott: four columns x y u* v* files for surface and bottom.
       The * is void (velocities), t (temporal derivatives) or d (material derivatives).
</ul> 
</ul>
  All files are written in dimensionless coordinates with the equilibrium 
  depth     as length scale and the linear shallow water celerity as 
    velocity scale. The peak of the solitary wave is located at x=0, unless 
    otherwise is specified by the -xpeak option.

/hom/geirkp/laplace/rusource/bin/solfelt.sh (options)
</pre>
Options
     <pre>
         -var arg : selects compiled version of applied fortran programs
                 default: corresponds to gfortran with double as standard
                          length of floats   
         -a a : sets amplitude to a
                default: 
         -xpeak arg : sets position of peak to arg
                default: arg=0.0
         -nber  arg : sets number of time intervals before extraction of
                      fields for potential program.   
                default: arg =0
         -nf  nf : sets resolution in potential program    
                default: nf = 5
         -t  t : sets integration time in potential program  
                 default: 0.1
         -B  B : sets half width of solitary wave field.  
                default: Width is computed on basis of eps and a
         -gstem  gstem : Sets the name of produced folders   
                default: gstem = solit
         -Vrim  Vrim : sets rim-width above crest in the fields  
                default: Vrim =0
         -eps  eps : sets truncation height, relative to a, for the outskirts
                     of the solitary wave.  
                default: 0.001
         -grid  n  m : sets the size of the grid to n x m points.
                default: 100 x 30
         -keep : This flag preserves intermediate folders (for debug purposes) 
                default: intermediate folders are erased.
         -f : Allow re-writing of existing folders
                default: existing folders are not over-written, but script 
                         aborts when this is attempted.
