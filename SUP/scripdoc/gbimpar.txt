The script is designed to assist the synchronization of runup models
with other simulations, or experiments, on solitary wave runup, where 
the available parameters are

      1. A location, xm, in the constant depth region where we know
         the maximum surface elevation A and the time, tm, when it occurs.
         This information may stem from a time series at x=xm or the
         surface profile at t=tm. xm is measured from the equilibrium 
         shoreline. 

      2. The beach angle.

      3. The maximum time (compatible with tm) for simulation and the
         time increment, tinc, between printouts.

Solitary wave propagation speeds, c, and half-lengths are 
calculated by the script.
The numerical tank-length and initial solitary wave position are chosen 
according to:

       i) The distance from the beach is at least a half-length.
      ii) The simulations starts at a time corresponding to t0 (must be added 
          to the time written by the runup programs). t0 is the largest time
          reconcilable with i) and such that t0+(an integer)*tinc equals
          ts.
     iii) The initial position of the wave is c*(tm-t0) away from xm, such that
          the maximum at t=tm should be x=xm. 

Use

  gbimpar.pe (options)
Allowable options
   -a A: Sets the amplitude (dimensionless, cm or m) 
     default: A=0.487  
   -xm xm:   Sets the distance from eq. shoreline to
              Normalization position (dimensionless, cm or m)
     default: xm=3.16217m  
   -vink arg:  Sets inclination angle in degrees.
     default: arg=7.18  
   -tm tm:   Sets the time of max elevation at xm (dimensionless or s) 
     default: tm=3.95s  
   -eps arg:  Set truncation height for solitons relative to amplitude.
              This will decide the width of flat region.
     default: arg=0.0005  
   -d arg: Depth in meter used with input data with scaling
     default: arg=0.20  
   -ts arg: The maximum time to simulate (dimensionless or s).
     default: arg=5.78s 
   -tinc arg: Increments between printout (dimensionless or s).
     default: arg=0.01s  
   -eq arg:  Chose equation. Options are lap, Bouss or Serre.
     default: arg=lap

Important parameters are (all dimensionless):

 flatl - length of flat region. Initial wave must be centered within this 
         region.
 tsimul - simulation time
 nut - number of simulation intervals 
 ntm - approximate number where crest passes xm
 knekk - horizontal distance from start of sloping bottom to eq. shoreline.
 t0 - time corresponding to t_local=0 in simulations.
 x0 - distance from eq. shoreline to initial crest. 
 The parameters with sec appended to their name are in seconds
