bounl.sh

This script computes boundary layer profiles and thicnesses at time
series locations used in simulations with the Lagrangian Boussinesq model.
It runs the program /hom/geirkp/boelge/bounlay/i386/gprof subsequently for all
the specified time series. Before the script is invoked the gsersplit.pe
must be applied to the time series in raw form. For (weakly) nonlinear
applications also the lagUxser.pe must be used prior to the present
script. Comparison of boundary flux defeciencies to total flux is enabled after
fluxser.pe. 

All input to bounl.sh must be in consistent dimensions or diemnsionless.
This also goes for nu (see below).

The maximum time step for the boundary layer model is specified.
The real time step is an integer fraction of the the time intervals in
the input files for the outer flow. The output files are 
(Ng=number of times series location, Nt - number of time for output) 

  Uz_Ng_Nt  - files with z, u  profiles
  dQ_Ng  - Mass flux defiency
  delt_Ng - Boundary layer thickness based on a set deviation from outer flow
            velocity
  accdQ_ng - Accumulated mass flux defiency
  zcord - z coordinates
  param.dat  - parameter file from gprof


Use: 

/hom/geirkp/lagbouss/bin/bounl.sh (options)

     -bdir arg : Sets folder for files from Boussinesq simulation
               default arg=..
     -pre arg :Name prefix for files from  gsersplit.pe
               default arg= Dim
     -ulin :Flg for weakly nonlinear boundary layer theory
               default is linear theory
     -strekk arg : Sets stretch factor for non-uniform grids in z
               default arg=4
     -grid arg : Sets type of z-grid (linear, exponential ...)
               default arg=exp
     -b arg : Sets z range  of computation domain. Must be scaled according to
               input time series. 
               default arg=0.02
     -nper arg : Sets number of lines in input files for outer flow that
                 are read between output of profiles.
               default arg corresponds to interval in printing in Boussinesq
               simulation (parameter nper)  
     -nu arg : Sets viscosity coefficient. Must be scaled according to
               input time series.
               default arg=0.000001 (Water, SI units)
     -nz arg : Set snumbr of points in profile
               default arg=50
     -dtmax arg : Sets dtmax.
               default dtmax equals the increment in input time series.
     -iclist arg : Sets a list of time series, either as a sequence of numbers
               (divided by a comma, or quoted and divided by blanks) or
               the special value 'all'
               default arg=1
