/hom/geirkp/bin/unslopg.pe reads sloppy gphov files and corrects for wrong
number of whitespaces by means of free format input in perl. Headerline 
must be unbroken in input, but subsequent lines may be freely formatted.

Use:


 unslopg.pe -o outfile infile

Options:
    -o arg: arg is name of outputfile
            Default: arg=gp.dat
