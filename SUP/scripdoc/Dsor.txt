Dsor.pe* Produces source input for gglo*


This script produces input files for the gglo program.
Invoked perl libraries and additional source code files:
   /hom/geirkp/bin/rotdat.pe
   /hom/geirkp/gitec/bin/lpf_inc.pe
   /hom/geirkp/gitec/bin/lesopt_inc.pe

Use:

/hom/geirkp/bouss/trappe/test/Dsor.pe \#DEF=<input-file> (options)

Where specifications are given in the input-file or as command line options.
A command line option of the form '-opt arg' correponds to a line in the file
containing "opt = arg". The blanks around = is mandatory and several
settings may be combined in a single line provided arg contains no whitespaces.
If a parameter is set both in the input-file and the command line the latter
has presedence. A parameter may also be set more than once in the file; 
the last setting being the one in effect.
  
The sources are specified on rectangular grid, with maximum source strength in (0,0).
The following files are generated (stem is set by option -stem and ext is .bin in binary mode, empty otherwise)
 stem.tim: Times. There are one more line in stem.tim than the number of
           source files.
 stem1, stem2 ... : Files in gphov format with source strengths.
 U0ext, V0ext : initial velocities (discrete mode only). 
 ets'ext' : surface elevation at the end of source duration
 hint'ext' : modified bottom 

parameters for script:
-x0 arg : Sets x-coordinate of lower left corner 
         default: -20
-y0 arg : Sets y-coordinate of lower left corner 
         default: -20
-t arg : Sets source duration.
         default: 10
-k arg1 arg2  : Sets decay rates of source strength
        default: 0.1 0.2
-L arg : Length of source region (x-direction)
        default: 40
-B arg : Width of source region (y-direction)
        default 40
-n arg : Number of points in x-direction
        default: 80
-m arg : Number of points in y-direction
        default: 80
-nt arg: Number of time intervals
        default: 10
-stem arg: Sets common stem for flux and time files.
        default: qqq
-a arg : Set strength of source
        default: 0.002
-bin :  Gives binary output for source files, surface elevations and 
        initial velocities.
        default: ascii is used
-fkod arg: Used with -bin. arg=f corresponds to 32 bit precision, arg=d 
           to 64 bit
       default: f
-analog : Computes the non-discrete fluxes and surface elevation. The discrete
          mode enables exact reproduction of surface elevation by gglo*, save 
          for round-off errors.
       default : discrete mode
