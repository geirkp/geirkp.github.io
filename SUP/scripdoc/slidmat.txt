     slidmat.pe

Purpose: Generation of matrices for seabed and slide-bodies from the output of
         boslide.new

Tools applied:
       /hom/geirkp/bouss/slide/bin/$sdir/dgen
         Fortran program reading slide shape, initial bottom matrix and 
         positions from the outputfiles of boslide.new

       /hom/geirkp/gitec/bin/getnew.pe
         Reading the slide height from param.dat

Main output files:
        name                      format            contents
       hbed.bin                   gphov/binary   The rigid seabed
     slibod.bin slibod$N.bin      gphov/binary    Slide bodies and depth  
       nvpos.dat                  genkurv          Positions of lower left 
                                                   corners of slide body.
                                                   

File structure and function:
      Script is invoked with the directory containing the boslide.new
      output as current directory. Produced files put in the current
      directory. 

parameters:
  -utform  arg  Defines the outputform for slide bodies, overlaid the depth.
                values: (abbrevations allowed)   
                       global:  same size as depth matrix, one file
                       combined: local matrices for slide bodies in a
                                 single file, lower
                                 left corners given in nvpos.dat 
                       local:   Separate files for each data set,
                                slibod1.bin slibo2.bin ... 
                default: global
   -eps arg     Lowers the seabed contributions to slibod.bin etc. by
                amount arg.
                Def: arg equals one per cent of slideheight
   -v0 arg      Defines decrease of lowering as function of slide height.
                At slide height arg, the lowering is reduced to 1/e.
                Def: arg equals one tenth of slideheight
