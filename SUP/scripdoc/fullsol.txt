.../geirkp/bin/fullsol

Computes solitary wave solutions by Tanaka's method or the fourth order
approximation by Fenton (1972). (solp program or Fprod program, the latter
not yet available at Blindern).
The output is a
file $pre$amp, where $amp is the amplitude/depth and $pre is an optional 
prefix ( set with -o option), with 4 columns: 

       x eta surface-potential  normal-derivative-surface-potential

The maximum surface elevation is located at x=0 and the data are dimensionless
with the depth (h) as length scale and sqrt(h/g) as time scale. 
In addition the script produces the file fullsol.par, with some
key parameters.


options:

     -dx arg : x increment is set to arg. Default arg=0.05
      -o arg : arg is used as prefix in output-filname. Default arg=fsol
      -n|-nmax arg: number of points used calculation. Default=3000
                    This will not equal the number in the output and
                    the number will not affect the results when sufficiently
                    large.
      -a|-amp arg : set amplitude/depth to arg. Default: arg=0.5 
      -eps|-tru arg: truncation limit for data. Default: arg=0.0003
                     No data are given for eta/h less than this limit
      -prog|-meth arg: arg must be either Tanaka or Fenton. If a>=0.1
                       Tanaka is default, for lower values Fenton is 
                       default.
      -keep : Intermadiate results from the Tanaka program is kept.
