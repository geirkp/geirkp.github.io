  /hom/geirkp/SUP/experiments/itperf.sh

  Performs an iteration on the paddle-input. The initial and final files are in
  volt, cm and seconds, while some intermediate ones are dimensionless.
  Everything is performed within a rigid filestructure (see below).
  Documentation on the structure is given in the script. 

  options
         -case arg: Sets case identifier
               default arg=IV
         -remove|-fjern arg: Forces the script to remove files produced
                  from the given number of iteration and exit 
               default arg=''
         -depth|-dyp arg: set the depth
               default arg=0.1
         -trunk arg: Truncation limit in dimensionless timeseries
               default arg=3.5
         -mid: Turn of regression in timsenew.sh
         -lin:  Sets regression type to linear for position in timsenew.sh 
               This is default
         -kvad:  Sets regression type to quadratic for position in timsenew.sh 
         -ulin:  Sets regression type to linear in lagtser.pe
                 default: no regression
         -ukvad: Sets regression type to quadratic in lagtser.pe 
         -ukub:  Sets regression type to quadratic in lagtser.pe
          -glatt arg: Number of pointwise smoothenings used in final production
                of new voltage (conveyed to lagtser.pe)
               default arg=0
         -sm arg: Number of pointwise smoothenings used in timsenew.sh
               default arg=4
         -fasit arg: name of file with the desired ("prescribed") 
                     paddle-displacement (in cm and s).  
               default arg='wave.dat'
         -hz arg: sampling rate for output voltage
               default arg=500
         -ibr arg: Number of points for regression in timsenew.sh
               default arg=3
         -uibr arg: Number of points for regression in lagtser.pe
               default is the default of lagtser.pe
 

    Filstructure:
      Starting at the current directory, where the script is run, we
      have the following folders and subfolders ($case is the case identifier)

      ./case$case
         contains intermediate and final files from script

      ./labview/case$case/$ni
         contains labview ouput for iteration $ni

      ./prescribed/case$case/$fasit
         contains the desired paddledisplacement as tx in file $fasit

      The ./case$case has subdirectories and files
          nn.dat - file with present iteration step at last line  
 
          $fasit - file with the desired paddledisplacement

          AS$ni - directory with output from timsenew.sh for iteration $ni
         

          STEP$ni - directory that review all iteration up to $ni. The most
                    important files are the 
                    volt1 .. volt"$ni+1" (t,voltage)
                    and the
                    padin2$depth ..padin"$ni+1"$depth (sampled voltage for 
                                                       input to labview)
