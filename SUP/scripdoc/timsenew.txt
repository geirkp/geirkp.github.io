/hom/geirkp/SUP/experiments/timsenew.sh reads input from labview and 
produce various outputfiles, with three points smoothing and regression.

         -goaldir arg: directory for produced files
                     default arg=.
         -noadj*:
         -depth|-dyp arg: set depth
                     default arg=0.2
         -trunk arg: Dimensionless truncation limit
                     default arg=3.5
         -ts arg: Offset of time series from labview
                  default arg=0
         -Uiw arg: Regression-types to be used for velocity calculations
                   l=linear, k=quadratic, q=qubic
                  default arg='l q'
         -Piw arg: Regression-types to be used for position calculations
                  default arg='l k q'
         -sm|-smlist arg: number of 3 point smoothings to be applied
                  default arg='2 8'
         -ibr|-I|-Ibrlist arg: list of half-widths for regression

#files produced:
#
#  tid.dat    - times for paddle data
#  padle_ut.dat - Voltage sent in paddle signal 
#  padlepos.dat - paddle position in cm
#
#  The corresponding unix formatted files have _unix appended
#
#  voltser.dat - voltage in genkurv format
#  posser.dat - paddleposition in genkurv-format
#  poscal.dat - paddleposition shifted with zero as start
#  voltscal.dat - voltage rescaled as to have zero start and same maximum as 
#                 paddle position
#  posnons.dat - position nondimensional (depth=lengthdscale, sqrt(g*depth)
#                as velocity-scale)
#  uBRsN    - velocities found by various differentiation. B, R, N are 
#               defined according to
#               B = m   mid point differences
#               B = l,k,q   linear, quadratic and cubic least square 
#                   regression (k has no significance for derivation)
#               R - half width of regression interval, for B=m identified
#                   as 1
#               N is number of piecewise smoothenings
#   pBRsN   - posistions. Same codes as for u-files. However, B=m means that
#             no regression is performed
