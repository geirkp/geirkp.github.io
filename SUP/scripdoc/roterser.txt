    roterser.pe

  Rotation of data from a column file. 
  The column must be either scalars, which are not transformed, or doublets
  that are either coordinates or velocities.

  Use 
   roterser.pe (-v vink) (-or x0 y0) (-nor nx0 ny0) (-sc sx sy) (-st st) (-sn sn) (-ctyp ct) (-form form) < input > output
   where
   -v vink: rotation angle for coordinate system (counter-clockwise).
            vink has the format Nunit, where N is a float and unit is either of
             degrees
             radians
             stign; meaning tangens of the angle 
            The unit may be abbreviated.
      default: vink=90deg 
   -or x0 y0: Old position of center of rotation. Affects only positions.
      default: 0.0 0.0 
   -nor nx0 ny0: New position of center of rotation.  Affects only positions.
      default: 0.0 0.0
   -sc sx sy: stretch factors for positions. For coordinates 
              it is the distances from
              x0, y0 which are stretched, while nx0 and ny0 are not 
              changed due to sx sy. Affects positions and velocities.
              All stretching is performed before rotation. 
               default: sx=sy=1  
   -st st: stretch factor for time. Affects velocities.
               default: st=1
   -sn sn: stretch factor for scalars.
               default: sn=1  
   -ctyp ct: ct is a sequnce of the letters 
              n  - indicating a single scalar column
              u  - indicating two columns defining a velocity 
              r  - indicating two columns defining a position
             For instance, ct=cun corresponds to a five column file
                   x y u v g
             where g is some scalar( such as density of mass).  
      default: ct=ru 
   -form form: Format for output columns
      default: %18.8e
