  A script that makes an alternative or subsequent Boussinesq runup simulation
  from the data of a BIM simulation. The script must be invoked in the folder
  where the data is located. Parameters and initial conditions are then fetched 
  from the BIM data.
 
  parameters:
  -nt  nt : makes the Boussinesq model start from dataset nt
          default: Start from the last BIM dataset
  -nut nut : number of time intervals. 
           default: as many as remains in BIM simulation, unless nt is the
              last BIM dataset. Then default is nut=10            
  -npoin n : number of points in Boussinesq simulation  
            default is left to knaai program
  -tint  tint : Sets length of time interval
            default:  The length is the same as in BIM simulation.
  -uvalg uvalg : Selects the way for construction of velocity data.
               Options:
                 mid : Use depth averaged velocity (felt.sh must be invoked)
                 surf: use surface velocity
                 soliton: Velocity is made from surface and celerity of 
                          incident Tanaka-soliton
            default: uvalg=mid  
  -sdir  sdir : name-stem of subdir for Boussinesq simulation.
            The full name of the subdirectory is
               'sdir''dform''nt'(n'npoin')
            where the last part is used only if npoin is set.
            default: sdir=bouss  
  -dispform dform : selects the dispersion term.
            default: dform= sing
