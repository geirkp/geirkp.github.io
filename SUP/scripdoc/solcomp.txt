solcomp
    Keywords: soliton sammenlikning comparison plots plott plotxy
    Compares the data on a two column (x,y - equidistant x) file with
    analytic soliton shapes. The data are truncated and translated as to 
    have maximum at zero in the file "zzzkapp". Analytic data are produced
    by the script "/hom/geirkp/bin/soliprod" and are stored in "ssamm.zzw".
    A plot with comparison is then produced by the "/hom/geirkp/bin/genkurv"
    script. Unless the -keep flag is employed the produced datafiles are 
    removed.
    Use:
      solcomp (-keep) (-nopl) (-likop arg) (-Bouss) (-Serre) (-hoSerre)
       (-kSerre) (-lap)  (op1 op2  ...) filnavn
      parametere:
         -keep: The produced files are not deleted at the end of the script.
         -nopl: same effect as -keep, apart from no plot being produced.
         -likop arg: arg may be -Serre, -Bouss or -lap (see below)
         -Bouss: Selects the Boussinesq soliton.
         -Serre: Selects the Serre soliton.
         -hoSerre: Selects the Serre soliton with Nwogu-like correction.
         -kSerre: Selects the Serre soliton with disp correction to O(k^4).
         -kdv: Kdv Soliton
         -lap: Selects the  soliton from full potential theory.
         op1 op2 ... is a list of parameters that is transferred to 'soliprod'.
                Most allowable parameters for "soliprod" may be included,
                except the  -a opsjonen and options defining the equations 
                behind the analytic solution. Warning: this feature may be
                a bit buggy. The list then includes
                -t
                -eta,-hast,-pot
                -eps arg
