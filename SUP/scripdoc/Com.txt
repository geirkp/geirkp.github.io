Com.pe* Production of Commit propagation files

The script converts propagation files for eta, u and v from 
gphov to netCDF as used in COMMIT. To do this the script is
run in a folder with data from a gglo (32 bit) simulation. It
invokes the gptocom conversion program. The
following files are being  read

 param.dat, yprop.ext, uprop.ext and vprop.ext    

where ext is bin (binary) or dat (ascii). The produced files are
 stem[yuv]a.nc, where stem is set as an option. Temporary files are ind[yuv] 
that are input files to gptocom and shstem.sh that contains shell code. Preferably, the gglo 
simulation should use spherical coordinates. Otherwise extra options are
needed. In addition to turning the data into netCDF format the script also
scales the data. Grid is in degrees, time in secons and length in cm.

Use /hom/geirkp/bouss/trappe/bin/Com.pe ( -ostem stem  -latitude x0 -longitude y0 -hchar arg -xchar arg  -vlow arg -vrep arg -dry)

Parameters:
-ostem stem: sets stem in names  for output
 -latitude x0 -longitude y0 : Used if the simulation is not in sperichal 
                coordinates. (x0,y0) is then the lower left corner 
                of the simulation grid 
               (not the part selected for propgation files). The precise 
               definition of (x0,y0) is given in the gglo report.
               The map factors are assumed constant if these options are
               used.
 -hchar arg : For dimensionless simulations, this sets the characteristic 
              depth in m. Is then also used for the grid.
 -vlow arg : sets lower treshold for data. If this is surpassed the value
             set by -vrep is invoked.
             default: arg=-500
 -vrep arg : replacement value
             default arg=0.0
