    <h1>Surface to velocity filter</h1>

    This page is a documentation of a f77 code for employing the Boussinesq/KdV
    theory to convert either a time series or a snapshot of the surface 
    elevation to corresponding data for the depth averaged velocities. 
<h3>The formulation</h3>
     The program Boussinesq equations with standard
     dispersion.
     Details and instructions for further use is found in a separate <a href="boussprof.pdf" > note</a> from /hom/geirkp/bouss/notes/vel-profiles.
<h3>Properties and features</h3>
<ul>
<li> The model employs only non-dimensional coordinates with the maximum depth 
as lengthscale. The depth in the flat bottom part of the tank is then 1 and the
 nondimensional time unit is the time used to travel one  length unit with the
linear long wave speed.   
All input and ouput is scaled this way.
<li> Read either a (t eta) or a (x eta) file, where t=time, 
     x=spatial coordinate, and eta is surface elevation. The coordinates
     (x or t) may have variable spacing.    
<li> The input is assumed to correspond to a unidiectional wave in the
     positive x-direction.(u and eta generally have similar signs) 
<li> The program produces files with velocities (umid) and double derivatives
     of velocities (uxx). The latter is subjected to a specified number of 5
     point smoothing.
<li> The algorithm itself surpress noise. Still the input velocities should
     be filtered and not over-sampled (too high sampling rate in relation to
     noise level.)
</ul>
<p>
<h3>The input and execution</h3>
        Two lines are read in a dialogue from standard input. 
         Lines starting with !
         are recognized as parameters.
         An example
<pre>
    !give eta-data/eta.in/
     inpfil
    !give number of 5 point smoothenings/ 0/
     0
</pre>
    This means that the input file with eta data is named inpfil and that
    0 smoothing will be employed.

    first uses rurun.pe and then reproduces an U time series by ufromg.
