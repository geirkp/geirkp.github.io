    The script rotates and transformes xy files from Boussinesq or BIM 
    runup models to  a system , sz, with coordinates pararallel and normal

    The origin for the rotated system in the equilibrium shoreline position.
    The necessary parameters are fetched from the param.dat file that must 
    reside in the same diretory as the datafile. From the content of param.dat
    (existence of parameter mvert) the script decies whether the data in 
    question are produced by the BIM or the Boussinesq model and transforms
    accordingly.
