gskred.pe

Purpose: Generation of series of simulations of slide generated waves.
         The bathymetry is a shelf and an abyssal plain connected with 
         a slope. A slide, of prescribed form and celerity, moves 
         perpendicular to the depth contours.

Tools applied: (hhost is a variable related to HOSTNAME)

File structure and function:
   Results are put in directories:
   $stem/$eq$hg/$formfun/n$n
   where stem is set by -sti option, eq describes equation (-likn),
   hg depth of shelf (-hg), formfun slide shape (-form) and n 
   grid refinement factor (-n) (grid increment proportional to 1/$n)
   
   The directory tree, with input files, are generated together with a
   sh file (at current directory) with name "$job"_$eq, containing the
   shell commands.
    

parameters:
-plan      selects 2D mode
           def: off 
-nf  arg   sets the grid refinement factors sequentially to the numbers
            (separated by blanks or commas) in the list given in the single
            argument arg. A value N yields roughly grid increments 1/N
            def: arg=1   
 -rfak  arg  reduction factor of time step relative to spatial increment
            def: arg=1 for dispersive, arg=sqrt(0.5) for hydrostatic case
 -nut  arg  sets number of output fields, at regular time intervals, to arg
            def: arg=10
  -t  arg   Sets maximum simulation time to arg. Def: duration of slide event
  -likn  arg   Selects equation type. Valid options for arg:  
                      hyd - linear hydrostatic  
                      disp - linear dispersive
                      airy - nonlinear hydrostatic  
                      bouss - Boussinesq equations
  -korr   Turns hydrostatic correction on. Default: off       
  -iit  arg Sets number of ADI iterations for Bernoulli (momentum)
             equation to arg. 
            (insignificant for equation type hyd) Default  arg=3  
  -kit  arg Sets number of ADI iterations for continuum equation to arg. 
            (insignificant for equation type hyd) Default  arg=2  
  -print  arg  Chooses the actual datasets to be printed. Values for
               arg may be, for instance:
                   '1 4 5' yielding sets 1, 5 and 7
                    '1:8;3' yielding sets 1, 4, 7
                    alle   yielding all sets 
               A star corresponds to the last set in the computed sequence
               Default arg=alle

  -ly   arg Sets length of domain in y-direction

        rightmost boundary.

  -uskred  arg   Sets maximum slide velocity to be arg
                default arg=0.4

              default: bell 
  -shelfw  arg    Sets shelf width to arg
           def arg=20  
  -hg arg  Sets shelf depth to arg. ( Deep water depth equals 1)
           def arg=0.3  
  -lheln  Sets slope length to arg.
          def arg=10  
  -lindyp Selects a linear rather than a sinusoidal slope that yields
          continuous bottom gradients everywhere.
          def: off   
  -rpy0  arg Defines initial y-position of slide.
         def: at shelf margin 
  -rpy1  arg Defines final y-position of slide.
         def: at end of slope 
  -out  arg Sets name of outputfile for surface-elevations.
         def: mach.bin  
  -gg  arg Selects type of Boussinesq equations (3D mode only)
         def: arg=1  
  -job  arg  Sets the start of the name of the sh file. Used to avoid
             that several simultaneous calls to the script produces
             job-files of identical names.
             def: arg=J  
  -sti  arg  Defines a path for the file directories.
             def: arg=.  
  -trig      Causes the produced sh file to be executed.
             def: off
  -hm arg    (2D mode only) selects minimum depth for adaptation of 
             nonuniform grid, in the sense that the grid points are
             re-distributed as to give similar crossing times for
             each grid box. arg=1 corresponds to a uniform grid.
             def: arg=1
  -igl arg   (2D mode only) sets number of smoothings in re-distributed
             grid.
             def: arg=4
