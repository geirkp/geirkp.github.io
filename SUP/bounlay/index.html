    <h1>Boundary layer program</h1>
This page is a documentation of a f77 code for importing an external velocity 
  field and performing linear and nonlinear boundary layer computations. 
A description of the numerical method is found in <a href="bounum.pdf"> bounum.pdf </a>, with source code 
in <a href="dokbo.tar"> dokbo.tar </a>, which must be unraveled with 'tar -xz < dokbo.tar'.

    <h1>The method</h1>
    Key points:
<ul>
   <li> The boundary layer equations are solved by FDM
   <li> A Crank-Nicholson method is used for the diffusion+ time evolution 
term
   <li> Upstream spatial differences are combined with backward temporal differences.
    <li> The  method is semi-explicit in the sense that only one sequence of 
        sweeps in the grid columns normal to the boundary is performed. For each column a single three-diagonal equation set is solved.
    <li> The grid resolution normal to the boundary is non-uniform.
    <li> At present the resolution along the boundary and in time are uniform
    <li> The forcing (pressure+gravity) is included as the acceleration of
         the outer flow. This is dicretized as to make the outer flow an exact 
         solution of the discrete boundary layer equations.
</ul>

<h3>The input and execution</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Parameters are read in a dialogue from standard input. 
         Lines starting with !
         are recognized as comments, there are some checks on the input
         and default values are generally offered. 
     <li> An file in gphov format (x and t) must be provided.
          The number of rows (number of times ) may be smaller than specified in the heading.
      <li> A two column trajectory file (t,x) may be provided for computing and
           printing some secondary quantities. Some quantities are linked to 
           the region to the left or right of the trajectory, as specified by a
           separate input parameter.
      <li> If dense time series a certain locations are wanted, then
           an single column input file with grid numbers can be specified.
           For these locations the parallel velocity is written with a
           given temporal sampling.
      <li> The following list of parameters are also given: A threshold velocity
           for definition of boundary layer thickness, normal resolution, normal grid structure, upper limitation of computational domain (should be larger than layer thickness), kinematic viscosity coefficient or inverse Reynolds number, printing frequency and maximum time step. If the latter is smaller than the step in the input file for the outer flow, the grid is temporally refined and the input data interpolated linearly in time.    
    </ul>

  <h3> The scaling, gravity and pressure gradients</h3>
  The program may run with a consistent set of dimensions or in 
  dimensionless mode. Input and output will then be scaled in the same
  manner.  It must be observed that also the kinematic viscosity coefficient
  must bes caled. For water this is nu=10**(-6) m**2/s. If SI units are used 
  in the input this value is to be used (for water). If, on the other hand, 
  the input is dimensionless with d as length and U as velocity scale 
  (U=sqrt{g*d} in standard scaling) the dimensionless viscosity factor
  becomes 1/Re, where the Reynolds number is Re=U*d/nu.
  The pressure gradient and the gravity component along the plane is
  implicitly given through the outer flow and are not to be specified.
