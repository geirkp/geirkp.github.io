    <h1>Procedure for doing boundary layer simulations for comparison with experiments on solitary waves</h1>
<h3>This page</h3>
     A first version written in Oct./Nov 2013. 
<h3>The basics</h3>
    In the following $Geirkp referes to the home directory of
    the user geirkp. At 30 Oct. 2013 this is /mn/anatu/ansatte-u1/geirkp.<br>
    The programs in use are 
<ol>
<li><a href="../scripdoc/fullsol.txt">fullsol</a> is  a script that computes solitary wave solutions. Either Tanaka's method is used for full potential theory, or Grimshaw's/Fenton's perturbation solution for small amplitudes.<p>
<li><a href="../rusource/index.html">BIM (Boundary integral Model)</a> for full potential theory. This is used to compute the velocity distributions for solitary waves at the 
bottom and  of the fluid. The program does not perform any time-stepping, but  prepares
the input for its postprocessor.<p>
<li><a href="../scripdoc/felt.txt">felt.sh </a> invokes the post-processor 
for the BIM model. This is used to compute the velocity distributions in 
the inner part of the fluid, as well as pressures, accelerations etc.<br>
These quantities are not stricly required for the boundary layer computations, 
but may be useful when larger FOVs are employed.<p>
<li><a href="../scripdoc/solfelt.html">solfelt.sh </a> is a combination of the three preceding entries. This is used to compute the velocity distributions for solitary waves. <p>
<li><a href="../bounlay/index.html">Boundary layer model.</a> This is a more 
general model than what is needed in the present context.<p>
bottom and in the inner of the fluid<p>
<li> A number of  general purpose applications (scripts and compiled programs)
<br>
</ol>
    These models/scripts are mainly run through a set of shell code snippets given in
    $Geirkp/lab/Heidi/genrun. These snippets are executed by
the <a href="../scripdoc/newrun.html">newrun</a> facility.
It is not recommended to modify these snippets.
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Create a new folder. Then make a softlink, copy and execute a file
      according to (use bash)
  <pre>
   ln -s $Geirkp/lab/Heidi/genrun .
   cp $Geirkp/lab/rprep.sh .
  </pre>
<h3>Initialization</h3>
  Always use bash. Go to the work folder and do
  <pre>
   . rprep.sh
  </pre>
  The code in rprep.sh defines Geirkp as an environment variable and 
  modifies the path. The following will not work unless this is invoked.

<h3>Obtaining solitary wave profiles</h3>
The command line
<pre>
fullsol -a 0.2 -dx 0.5 -eps 0.001 -o ffff
</pre>
produces a file ffff0.2, which contains surface elevations, velocities etc., and
a parameter file fullsol.par which, among other things, gives the wave celerity c. <a href="../scripdoc/fullsol.txt">Click for more details on fullsol.</a>

<h3> Computing Boundary layers</h3>
<h4> Running the snippet</h4>
The outer flow, from a solitary, and the boundary layer are coputed by invoking the "snippet-command" Gsolb as is shown in the examples below. The snippet
is essentially a wrap of <a href="../scripdoc/solfelt.html">solfelt.sh,
 <a href="../scripdoc/fullsol.txt">fullsol</a> or  <a href="../scripdoc/soliprod.txt">soliprod</a>, and
the boundary layer program.
<pre>
newrun -pre 'mode=nonlin;sol=Tanaka;L=50;a=0.3;d=0.2;dx=0.2;nz=100;' Gsolbl
newrun -pre 'mode=nonlin;sol=Fenton;L=50;a=0.3;d=0.2;dx=0.2;nz=100;' Gsolbl
</pre>
where the specified parameters are
<ul>
<li>mode: specifies the kind of boundary value model to be used <br>
Values: nonlin, lin or Vittori. The last assumes a spatially uniform
outer flow, with a time history like that of the flow from the solitary wave,
and a separate program is then used. <br>
  Default: nonlin
<li>sol: chooses solitary wave solution<br>
     Values: Tanaka, Fenton, Serre or Bouss.
<li> L: Approximate length of computation domain in depth.<br>
     Default: 50
<li> a: amplitude to deth ratio.<br>
    Default: 0.3
<li>d: depth in meter<br>
    Default: 0.2
<li>dx=0.2: spatial resolution (in depths)<br>
    Default: 0.2
<li>nz: number of points in the vertical<br>
    Default: 200
</ul>
Lists separated by commas are accepted for mode and  dx.
<h4> The data</h4>
<ol>
<li> File structure<br>
    The examples above produce the folders
<pre>
Gsolbld0.2/a0.3Tanakanonlin/dx0.2nz100
Gsolbld0.2/a0.3Fentonnonlin/dx0.2nz100
</pre>
whith the files
<ul>
<li> uinNT vinNT uxNT : Fields for the parallell velocity (u), normal velocity 
(v) and the along-bottom derivative of u<br>
    These are ascii files in a specific <a href="../gpxyconv/index.html"> format </a>.
For solitary waves there is a huge redundancy in the data; the same profiles 
 are inherent in many datafiles for different values of x.
<li> U.out: the outer velocities which are input to the boundary layer program.
<li> zcord: two column file with vertical grid node and position.
<li> soliprod.par, param.dat, skyv.dat : parameter files
<li> Many other files which are unexplained; for now.
</ul>
<li>Scaling<br>
<ul>
<li> All compuations are done in dimensionless coordinates with
     the depth as length scale and d/sqrt(g*d) as time scale.
<li> At t=0 the peak of the solitary wave is at x=0. We may then define
     a phase as xi=x-ct, where c is given in the file soliprod.par. 
<li> The file uinNT contains u at time level NT. The time is NT*nbet*dt
     where nbet and dt are parameters from the file param.dat.<br>
     The first line of uinNT contains
<pre>
*   nz+1   nx   dz_av  dx   *    x0     *
</pre>
where * marks dummy value (in the present context), nz+1 is the number of
grid points in the z-direction. dz_av is average increment in z direction (file
zcord defines the real node positions) , dx is x-increment, and x0 is x 
position of leftmost nodes. The phase of column k then becomes
<pre>
xi=x0+(k-1)*dx-c*NT*nbet*dt
</pre>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3> A simple tool to check the data</h3>
The Nspreadplot snippet compares profiles for different combinations of 
parameters. This may be utilized to check the data qualitatively, as well
as quantitatively with respect to resolution, choice of model and 
presence of end effects. The latter is due to the finite computational domain.
<a href="fas2Na0.3.pdf"> Example</a>
<pre>
newrun -pre 'a=0.3;d=0.2;times=25,22;ymax=0.015;modeliste=Fentonnonlin,
Tanakanonlin;fase=2;nzliste=100,200' Nspreadplot
</pre>
where the lineshift is edited and should not be used in the shell command. 
Default values are available for all parameters. The times variable, and all that ends with liste, takes a series of comma-separated values as input. 
The times correspond to NT as defined above.
Graphs appear in separate windows, while data and graphical code (.eps)
are found in the folder divgraf/Nspreadplot.
