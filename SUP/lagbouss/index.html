    <h1>Wave tank program</h1>

    This page is a documentation of a (mainly) f77 code for solving the 
    Boussinesq 
    equations in Lagrangian coordinates in a wave tank with a piston-type 
    wave paddle
    and a sloping beach at the other end. 
    The program has a long and winding history and a complex 
    organisation. The present documentation may be insufficient to
    design a simulation from scratch. The use of the script  <a href="../scripdoc/rurun.txt">rurun.pe </a>  is recommened.

    In February 2013 an extension was made to include simplified slides and
    other bottom sources, through a F90 module. In the autumn of 2013 
    obsolete features
    were removed and a stretched grid introduced, in the fashion of the <a href="../rusource/index.html">BIM model </a>. As part of the revision in late 2013
    the grid is by definition non-uniform also in the Lagrangian coordinate.  
    
<h3>The formulation</h3>
     The program is based on Boussinesq equations with full non-linearity. Such a set is sometimes denoted
     as Serres' equation. The dispersion is either a standard one or improved to
     give similar linear dispersion properties as the Nwogu model. This is 
     obtained by adding a higher order term as is done in the  <a href="../globouss/index.html"> Globouss </a>model,
     except that the term now is nonlinear to preserve full nonlinearity.
     Some information on the model and benchmarking is found in an <a href="Geir.pdf" > abstract</a> from the Catalina Island 2004 meeting and references therein. In the <a href="../../geirtalks/Toronto2011/talk.pdf"> presentation, pages 30-41, </a>the model including the improved dispersion and extra nonlinearity is 
given( page 35).
<h3>Main features</h3>
Features included
<ul>
<li> Full nonlinearity 
<li> Dispersion with extra nonlinearities and optimisation with 
respect to dispersion properties in constant depth.
<li> Fully Lagrangian coordinates
<li> The shoreline is automatically tracked.
<li> A moving wave paddle of piston type. Input from a given profile or 
file.
<li> Solitary waves as initial conditions. The solitary wave solution is fully 
     consistent with the Boussinesq equations employed.
<li> Velocities and surface read as initial conditions and interpolated on
     the computational grid.
<li> One particular form of sub-aerial slide from the Catalina benchmark no. 3.
     The implementation of a slide as a time dependent bottom in the 
     equations is general, but
     this particular slide shape is the only one supported.
<li> (Only new version) Simplified bottom sources, subaerial or submarine, corresponding to slides
     (or uplift) by means of general shape functions read from file.
<li> Obsolete: Comparison with analytical solution of Carrier and Greenspan on an inclined plane. This feature is still present in the old version, but must be
  regarded as untested. Last used in the 1990s. 
<li> Two different gradient-dependent diffusion schemes. One is supposed to
     correspond to that of FUNWAVE.
<li> (Only new version) A refined  grid near the shore. The grid is specified
     by a simple formula, but does not provide a constant CFL number during
     shoaling. Hence, it is most useful for increased accuracy in the
     vicinity of the shoreline. Initial conditions are first computed on
     a uniform grid and then interpolated, as in a re-gridding procedure. 
<li> Output of fields and time series.
</ul>

<h3> Geometry and coordinate system </h3>
 In its present form the model requires a smooth bottom profile. Only
     a numeric wave tank with a piston to the right (maximum x) and a beach to
     the left is now available. The equilibrium shoreline is at x=0 and there 
     is smooth transition between the constant depth region and the inclined
     plane (beach).<p>
 The model employs only non-dimensional coordinates with the maximum depth 
as length scale. The depth in the flat bottom part of the tank is then 1 and the
 non-dimensional time unit is the time used to travel one  length unit with the
linear long wave speed.   
All input and output is scaled this way.
<h4>Refined grid nearshore</h4>
A new feature from September 2013 with a non-uniform grid
  defined as for the surface in the <a href="../rusource/shelfgrid.html">BIM model </a>.
<p>
<h3>The input and execution</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Parameters are read in a dialogue from standard input. 
         Lines starting with !
         are recognised as comments, there are some checks on the input
         and default values are generally offered. The program is occasionally 
         modified with implications for the dialogue.
         The interface script 
        <a href="../scripdoc/rurun.txt">rurun.pe </a> 
         provides backward compatibility and
         extra functionality and should be preferred to direct application
         of input files.
    <li> Initial/boundary conditions may specified in the following manners
       <ol>
        <li>carrier-greenspan: test simulations on analytic solution from
            Carrier and Greenspan 1958
        <li>cohat-paddle: A pulse of predefined shape is made by the paddle.
                          Amplitude and length (approximately) on produced
                          waves are read.
         <li>file-paddle: paddle motion is read from file
         <li>soliton-felt: initial condition is set to a solitary wave
         <li> full-felt: initial conditions are read from files. Filenames 
               have the form stem.eta and stem.u, where the stem is specified.
         <li>Catalina-slide: Benchmark 3 from Catalina meeting
         <li>Earthquake: Bottom sources. Physical significance is yet doubtful.
         <li>Slide: slide of permanent height and shape. Shape functions read 
             from file.
        </ol>
         The different options may not be combined.
 </ul>
    <h3> Output </h3>
      <ol>
       <li> param.dat -- file with parameters in particular format. 
            In addition to the input parameters also some output parameters 
            are included.
       <li> Runup files (data from beach region)
         <ul> 
              <li>beach.dat -- time,xbeach,x(1),x(2),u(1),u(2),ybeach,h(1),h(2)<br>
                  xbeach,ybeach defines the position of the beach. 
                  The numbered quantities are field variables adjacent to beach; x=position, u=velocity, h=total water depth. 
              <li>R.dat -- time,xbeach,rerr,rerr2,rerrl - the latter 3 is only 
              meaningful for Carrier and Greenspan type simulations 
              <li>GR.dat -- Used for control only
              <li> bgradH.dat, bgradx.dat - files with derivatives of
                  H and x, espectively, at the shoreline.<br>
                  Columns: t Fad Faad Fc Fac Faac Fq Faq Faaq Fl Fal<br>
                  where F is x or H, Fad and Faad are a FD approximation to 
                  dF/da and the second derivative, respectively;
                  F*c, F*q, F*l are approximations by cubic, quadratic and 
                 linear 
                  regression, respectively.
          </ul>
       <li> At selected intervals the the field variables are printed. 
            N is the number of time for output that corresponds to N*nper*dt, 
            where  nper and dt are given in param.dat. The data files are not 
            equidistant in the first column that is the horizontal
             position.<br>
             etaN :  surface positions (xy)<br>
             HN : total water depth<br>
             vN : time derivatives of total water depth<br>
            UnumN : horizontal velocities <br>
            udN : horizontal accelerations<br>
            udhN : hydrostatic part of horizontal acceleration -- corresponds to the gradient of the surface elevation. <br>
            dkN : if diffusion is activated the coefficient is written.   <br>
        <li> At max runup no. I the surface is printed in maxI, at max drawdown
 corresponding files minI are generated. When the simulation is stopped due to 
breaking files with BRYT in their names are generated.
        <li> Time series are extracted at specified, fixed, x positions.
             Number of time series is ngauge in param.dat. The positions in found in file<br>
         
             gaugpos: x, Ho, h, dHo/dx, dh/dx, h_xx, h_xxx (h -depth function, _xx double derivative)<br>
             The field value are foun either in gphov files, where each 
             row corresponds to a single time or an ad-hoc format.<br>
             gphov files: ES$slag with slag in eta, u, v or ut. 
             From these two-column files may be obtained by CEulsplit.sh<br>
             Ad-hoc files: <br>
             ugauge: time, u ,v, dv/dx (v is time derivative of H)<br> 
             agauge: time, du/dt <br>
             hgauge: time, eta, H, dH/dx (H is total depth) <br>
             Here Ho denotes the initial fluid height at the position.
             When more that one point is specified  the sequence of the field 
             values is repeated, but with maximum ten numbers per line.
             A single time will then span several lines. Individual two-column
             time series files may be produced with <a href="../scripdoc/gsersplit.txt"> gsersplit.pe</a>. 
        <li> Lagrangian time series are written for specified nodes.
             Number of time series is nserlag in param.dat
             files: <br>
             lagspos: nodenumber, Ho<br>
             lagser: For each time step the nodal values are written 
                     subsequently. The number of lines in the file is thus the 
                     number of series times the number of time steps computed.
                     Each line contains
                     time, x, u, hu, xH , H, v, hH<br>
                     Here time is time for x and H, xH is x positon at H node,
                     hu and hH are equilibrium depths at x and xH, respectively.
                   Individual two-column
                  time series files may be produced with <a href="../scripdoc/lagsersplit.txt"> lagsersplit.pe</a>.
      <li> Misc:
      <ul>
      <li> max.dat: time, xmax, etamax, h <br>
           Time series f maximum surface elevation. h is the equilibrium depth
           at the maximum point.
      <li> wall.dat -- paddle position
      </ul>
      <li> Files for variable grid
        <ul>
        <li> xg_or -- The basic grid on the unity interval (0 is shoreline)
         <li> xg -- The smoothened version of the basic grid 
         <li> xxi -- Grid interpolated onto x-nodes, still on unit interval  
         <li> *regr0 -- with * equal to x, v, h, eta, hin, Unum and wx. 
             The initial fields on the non-uniform grid. wx is initial x used
             for h nodes.
