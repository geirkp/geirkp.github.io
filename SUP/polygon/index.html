    <h1>Program for smoothing of polygon data</h1>
    The program reads the points of a polygon in x and y together with
    a transition interval in x. Data are then generated where the polygon
    is smoothed by a polynomial, giving continuous second derivatives,
    in the transition intervals. The program will not work properly if the
    transition intervals do overlap.
  <h3> Use</h3>
    An input file to the program may read (see example)
    <pre>
!give file
korn.dat
!give interval
1 11
!give n
100
!give undef value/-666/

!give tolerance at boundaries/1.0e-7/

 </pre>
Here the file korn.dat contains three columns, x , y and transition interval.
An interval, not necessarily coinciding with the interval in the x-data -- even though this is the default , is given. The number of grid points in the smooth data is set to 100, while x values outside the polygon data are assigned y-values
as given by undef (default -666). All outside points within tolerance is redefined as interior points.

  <h3> The code</h3>
  Some documentation of key routines is found in the source codes.

  <h3> An example</h3>
    An example is given in this directory in <a href="exsnippet.sh"> exsnippet.sh </a> that must be run on an linux computer.
    The program interprets as a comment every line on
    stdin starting with a '!'. The result files from the script is found in the sub-folder <a href="mpol"> mpol </a>. The polygon and the smooth data are depicted below.
