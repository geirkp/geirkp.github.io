    <h1>Procedure for doing runup simulations for comparison with experiments</h1>
<h3>This page</h3>
     A first version was written in October 2010. Smaller amendments were made before
     the parts about boundary layers were added in Mars 2011. More additions may follow.  
<h3>The basics</h3>
    The numerical models in use are a <a href="../lagbouss/index.html">Lagrangian Boussines model</a> and a <a href="../rusource/index.html">BIM (Boundary integral Model)</a> for full potential theory.<p>

    These models are run through a set of shell code snippets given in
    /hom/geirkp/lab/Erika/genrun. These snippets are executed by
the <a href="../scripdoc/newrun.html">newrun</a> facility.
<h3>The steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Create a new folder. Then make a softlink, copy and execute a file
      according to (in bash; start with command: sh)
  <pre>
   ln -s /hom/geirkp/lab/Erika/genrun .
   cp /hom/geirkp/lab/rprep.sh .
   . rprep.sh
  </pre>
   If a tcshell is used the last two lines are substituted according to
   <pre>
   ln -s /hom/geirkp/lab/Erika/genrun .
   cp /hom/geirkp/lab/rprep.tcsh .
   source rprep.tcsh
   </pre>
<li> Copying the lab data.<br> A folder of lab data is copied to the folder
     'labdata/date', where date is given as YYYYMMDD. In this folder
     the single row file 'xy_positions' gives the the position, in cm, of the 
     gauges relative to the beach. It is required that the gauge locations 
are sorted with increasingly onshore positions down the file. The subfolder 'caseNN' contains the
     'gaugerunMM.lvm' for each run numbered MM. Presently the number of gauges
     are 4, such that this is a 5 column file.
<li> Nondimensionalising and splitting of labdata.<br>
     To this end the snippet 'norgauge' is used, with specification of date,
     case and gauges. Example:
<pre>
     newrun -pre 'case=10;date=20101018;gauge=1,2,3,4' norgauge
</pre>
<li> Next step is synchronize the simulations, or rather determine
     essential parameters for the simulation which assure synchronization.
     The script <a href="../scripdoc/gbimpar.txt"> gbimpar.pe </a>
     is then used. Examples
<pre>
     newrun -pre 'case=10;date=20101018' timing
     newrun -pre 'ts=10s;tinc=0.1s;case=10;date=20101018' timing
</pre>
    In the latter case the simulations is set to end at 10 seconds lab-time
    and output fields at 0.1 seconds interval. The results of the snippet is put in the folder 'timing/date', with files 'hxy' (depth at gauges), 'Nxy' (dimensionless gauge positions),  'lapgbimp30.par' (parameter file for full potential  model) and  Serregbimp30.par (parameter file for Boussinesq (Serre) model).
<li> Run of simulation models.<br>
     The Boussinesq model is run by, for instance,
<pre>
     newrun -pre 'n=600,1200;case=10;date=20101018' boussrup
</pre>
     where n describes the list of resolutions, specified by number of 
     grid points, that will be used. A lot of other parameters may be set 
     as well. The above line will generate two folders for the results, namely,
<pre>
      boussrup1020101018Blokkreg/n600
      boussrup1020101018Blokkreg/n1200
</pre>
     The structure then is boussrup'case''date'Blokkreg/n'n'. The files
   Seta'M' and  Su'M' then contains the time series of surface elevation and
   velocity for gauge totalnumber -M+1. For onshore gauges the  Seta'M' must be corrected for 
   the depth at the gauge positions (see the timing part above).<br>
   Correpondingly the BIM simulations are made by
<pre>
     newrun -pre 'nf=3,5,7;case=10;date=20101018' solrup
</pre>
   where nf now specifies the resolution in relative terms. The cpu time
   does not scale very nicely. Hence a nf value larger than 7 may lead to
   huge computational times. The folders now become
<pre>
     solrupcase102010101810.0/a0.0974597/quad6one6GF8/nf3red1_6_3f0.4
     solrupcase102010101810.0/a0.0974597/quad6one6GF8/nf5red1_6_3f0.4
     solrupcase102010101810.0/a0.0974597/quad6one6GF8/nf7red1_6_3f0.4
</pre>
    The pattern is solrupcase'case''date''slope'/a'amplitude'/quad6one6GF8/nf'nf'red1_6_3f0.4. The amplitude is as given in the lapgbimp10.par file in
 the timiing/date directory. A lot of other parameters are set as default, 
 based on the case and beach slope. The time series files for gauge M are now
 lapgaugeM for surface and lapgaugeuM/lapgaugevM for velocity components
 at the surface.
<li> Postprocessing.<br>
   Some postprocessing is included in the simulation snippets. This includes
   <ul>
    <li> Extraction and formatting of time series at gauge positions.
    <li> From November 10th 2010: formatting of the shoreline motion.
         Otherwise this formatting may be performed by, for instance
  <pre>
     /hom/geirkp/lab/Erika/lapbeach.sh  -case 10 -date 20101018 -ddir solrupcase102010101810.0/a0.0974597/quad6one6GF8/nf7red1_6_3f0.4
     /hom/geirkp/lab/Erika/boussbeach.sh  -case 10 -date 20101018 -ddir boussrup1020101018Blokkreg/n1200
  </pre>
     when in the project folder. The result will be a file Shoreser.dat.
   </ul>
</ol>
   <p>
<h3>The data-files</h3>
 Unless otherwise is specified all data are dimensionless with the depth, d, as 
 length scale and sqrt(d/g) as time scale. The times are synchronized with 
the laboratory time line. 
<ol>
<li> Maximum runup<br>
     The file param.dat contains input, as well as a few output, parameters.
     For Boussinesq simulations the parameter  R1 in param.dat is the value of R/A for the first runup. For the BIM simulations the corresponding parameter, R1, is found in the file runres.dat.
<li> Time series for the surface at gauge positions.<br>
     These are given as two column files: time vertical-coordinate. When 
     compared to flow depth measurements the vertical position of the beach 
     must be subtracted from the numerical series. Still a small eror may 
     remain due to the angle of the accoustic probe. Files
     <ul>
     <li> Boussinesq: Seta'M'contains the time series of surface elevation 
          for gauge with number -M+1.
     <li> BIM: lapgaugeM contains the time series of surface elevation 
          for gauge with number M.
     </ul>    
  <li> Shoreline motion.<br>
      For both Boussinesq and BIM the file Shoreser.dat is a 4 column file
      with t x s y, where t is (lab) time, and x, s and are positions horizontally, 
      along beach and vertically, respectively. All of x, s and y are zero 
      at the equilibrium shoreline and are positive during runup.    
</ol>

<h3>Boundary layer computations</h3>
<ol>
<li> It may be a good idea synchronize the writing of fields more properly.
     This is done by adding some settings to the timing snippet:
<pre>
newrun -pre 'ts=8.1s;tinc=0.1s;case=10;date=20101018' timing
</pre>
The simulations which then will be performed with reference to the given case and date
will run until 8.1 seconds (lab time) and fields will be outputted at 0.1 seconds 
intervals before this time.
<li> The computation of boundary layers requires special computations with time series in 
     a specific "block" form. Commands may run like
<pre>
newrun -pre 'case=10;date=20101018;nf=7;skipgauge=yes;npunkt=400;red=0.2' solrup
newrun -pre 'n=1200;case=10;npunkt=400;skipgauge=yes' boussrup
</pre>
As compared to the invocations of the solrup and boussrup snippets above, two new 
features have been added. First 'skipgauge=yes' which suppresses the automatic writing
of time series at the gauge locations. Secondly, the 'npunkt=400' setting turn the
output mode for time series to a block form (the BIM model always uses block form) giving a 400 x (number of timesteps+1) <a href="../gpxyconv/index.html" > gphov </a>files with 400 points along the beach. The span covered is specified in  
/hom/geirkp/lab/knekkstrand/Misc.par (variables Eserlim and Eserbeach). This may be generalized. Last, the red=0.2 causes a smaller time step in the BIM model, giving 
a denser temporal output. This may be an advantage for boundary layer simulations.  <br>
The above 'solrup' and 'boussrup' applications yield the folders
<pre>
solrupcase1020101018Blokk40010.0
boussrup1020101018Blokk400reg
<pre>
with subfolder structures as given above.
<li> For BIM the tangential velocity at the bottom, in file ESusb, are used for boundary 
layer computations. For the Boussinesq model the horizontal, average velocities in ESu
are used. The difference between averaged and bottom velocities, as well as that between
horizontal and along-bottom components, is of minor importance.
<li> The Boundary layers are computed by a separate fortran <a href="../bounlay/index.html">program</a>.   This program is invoked by commands like
<pre>
newrun -pre 'red=0.2;case=10;nz=200;nx=400;mode=nonlin;n=7;trac=stop' Lblayer
newrun -pre 'red=0.2;case=10;nz=200;nx=400;mode=lin;n=7;trac=stop' Lblayer
newrun -pre 'case=10;nz=200;nx=400;mode=nonlin;n=1200;trac=stop' Mblayer
</pre>
Lblayer is for the BIM model, Mblayer for the Boussinesq model. The parameters are
<ul>
<li> n - resolution, corresponds to nf in the solrup and n in the boussrup snippets.
<li> red, case, nx - as in  the solrup or the boussrup snippets.
<li> mode - selects either linear or nonlinear boundary value theory
<li> nz - number of points normal to beach 
<li> nper (optional) - number of time steps between outputs (time step is as in 
     BIM or Boussinesq model). Default give output of velocity fields which is
     synchronous with BIM/Boussinesq simulation.
<li> trac -- the special value stop prevents integration of quantities along a 
     a particle trace. Tracing cannot be performed until some special preparations are made.
</ul>
Lists separated by commas are accepted for mode, nx, nz and n.
The Mblayer and Lblayer snippets will generate subfolders under the simulation folder
named blaynonlin200, blaylin200 where the number corresponds to nz.
