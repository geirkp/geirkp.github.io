The meaning of some of the internal parameters as 
written in param.dat


Array limit parameters
-------------------------

ns - maximum number of unknowns in fields, including 
     a rim of fioctitous points.
nlin - maximum number of points in one direction (including fictitous)
lu -  maximum number of wet patches in each row or line
ntmax - maximum number of time steps in each interval (see ndt below)
ntps - maximum number of time series points 
nnz - maximum size of bottomflux arrays
ntz - maximum number of times for integration of bottom fluxes.

Scaling parameters
-------------------

Due to geographic grid there is both an length scale (used in relation to
surface elevation etc) and a grid scale.

lunit - length unit conversion factor(in m) used in input etc.
        If km is used then lunit=1000
tunit - time unit conversion factor (in seconds) used in input etc.
hchar - height scale in lunit, used to make the depth and surface elevation 
        dimensionless.
xchar - grid length scale in lunit.
        If cartesian coordinates are used this is simply hchar,
        otherwise it is the number of degrees latitude that an arc-length equal
        to hchar corresponds to.  
tchar - sqrt(hchar/gunit), where gunit is acceleration of gravity in 
        the set units
uchar - The ratio hchar/tchar, the scale of velocities
utsceta - conversion factor between non-dimensional eta and eta in output.
          kept for backward compability
lcut, tcut - conversion factors between non-dimensional length, time and
           those of output.


Grid parameters
-----------------
 x0,y0,dx,dy - lower left corner and increments as given in input
 x0n,y0n,dxn,dyn - Dimensionless grid parameters (x0n=x0/hchar...) 
 x0u,y0u,dxu,dyu - Grid parameters  as used in ouput of fields
 x0g,y0g,dxg,dyg - Grid parameters from depth matrix

 n,m - grid size in simulation
 ng,mg - grid size correponding to depth matrix, rim points not
         included
 

Temporal parameters
---------------------------------------------------------
dt,dtn - time steps, as in input and dimensionless
nut - number of intervals between outprints
ndt - time steps in each interval

Time series
-----------------------------------------------------
ntpu,ntpv,ntpy - number of points for u, v and eta, respectively.
