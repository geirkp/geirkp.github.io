    <h1>Procedure for doing runup simulations with BIM and Boussinesq model</h1>
<h3>This page</h3>
    Is adapted from <a href="../LabTheory/index.html"> the corresponding SUP page. </a> Some  features may appear irrelevant in 
a general context.
<h3>The basics</h3>
    The numerical models in use are a <a href="../lagbouss/index.html">Lagrangian Boussines model</a> and a <a href="../rusource/index.html">BIM (Boundary integral Model)</a> for full potential theory.<p>

    These models are run through a set of shell code snippets given in
    /hom/geirkp/lab/Erika/genrun. These snippets are executed by
the <a href="../scripdoc/newrun.html">newrun</a> facility.
<h3>The steps</h3>
 Always use the bash shell. <br>
In the following $Geirkp referes to the home directory of
    the user geirkp. As of 7th March 2014 this is /mn/anatu/ansatte-u1/geirkp.<br>
The rprep.sh snippet defines $Geirkp as an environment variable.
<ol>
  <li> Create a new folder. Then make a softlink, copy and execute a file
      according to 
  <pre>
   cp $Geirkp/lab/rprep.sh .
   . rprep.sh
   ln -s $Geirkp/lab/Erika/genrun .
  </pre>
   In each new session the rprep.sh has to be invoked to set environment variables and paths.
<li> Next step is to specify parameters and to synchronize the simulations,
     or rather determine
     essential parameters for the simulation which allow synchronization.
     The script <a href="../scripdoc/gbimpar.txt"> gbimpar.pe </a>
     is then used. Example
<pre>
     newrun -pre 'a=0.09;tm=3s;d=1m;xm=3m;slope=10;ts=10s;tinc=0.1s;case=10;date=20101018' Tim
</pre>
    The date and case parameters may seem superfluous, but are useful
    for organising sets of simulations.
    For  experiments 'date' is the date of experiment, while case is the
    name given to the parameter selection employed (however, snippet timing should be used instead of Tim then). For other purposes
    they may carry information on beach angle and amplitude, as well as other
    particulars.
    If 'case' and 'date' are omitted the default values are a$a ($a is the value of 'a') ans slope$slope, respectively. Hence, the two following commands have the same effect
    <pre>
     newrun -pre 'a=0.09;tm=3s;d=1m;xm=3m;slope=10;ts=10s;tinc=0.1s;' Tim
     newrun -pre 'a=0.09;tm=3s;d=1m;xm=3m;slope=10;ts=10s;tinc=0.1s;case=a0.09;date=slope10;' Tim
    </pre>
    In the examples a is amplitude to depth, tm is time for maximum at reference
    position xm (from shore) , d is equilibrium depth and slope is beach angle
    in degrees. 
    The simulations is set to end at 10 seconds reference-time
    and output fields at 0.1 seconds interval. The results of the snippet is put in the folder 'timing/slope10', with files 'hxy' (depth at gauges), 'Nxy' (dimensionless gauge positions),  'lapgbimpa0.09.par' (parameter file for full potential  model) and  Serregbimpa0.09.par (parameter file for Boussinesq (Serre) model).
<li> Run of simulation models.<br>
     The Boussinesq model is run by, for instance,
<pre>
     newrun -pre 'n=600,1200;case=a0.09;date=slope10' boussrup
</pre>
     where n describes the list of resolutions, specified by number of 
     grid points, that will be used. A lot of other parameters may be set 
     as well. The above line will generate two folders for the results, namely,
<pre>
      boussrupa0.09slope10Blokkreg/n600
      boussrupa0.09slope10Blokkreg/n1200
</pre>
     The structure then is boussrup'case''date'Blokkreg/n'n'. The files
   Seta'M' and  Su'M' then contains the time series of surface elevation and
   velocity for gauge totalnumber -M+1. For onshore gauges the  Seta'M' must be corrected for 
   the depth at the gauge positions (see the timing part above).<br>
   Correpondingly the BIM simulations are made by
<pre>
     newrun -pre 'nf=3,5,7;case=a0.09;date=slope10' solrup
</pre>
   where nf now specifies the resolution in relative terms. The cpu time
   does not scale very nicely. Hence a nf value larger than 7 may lead to
   huge computational times. The folders now become
<pre>
     solrupcasea0.09slope1010.0/a0.09/quad6one6GF8/nf3red1_6_3f0.4
     solrupcasea0.09slope1010.0/a0.09/quad6one6GF8/nf5red1_6_3f0.4
     solrupcasea0.09slope1010.0/a0.09/quad6one6GF8/nf7red1_6_3f0.4
</pre>
    The pattern is solrupcase'case''date''slope'/a'amplitude'/quad6one6GF8/nf'nf'red1_6_3f0.4. The amplitude is as given in the lapgbimpa0.09.par file in
 the timing/date directory. A lot of other parameters are set as default, 
 based on the case and beach slope. The time series files for gauge M are now
 lapgaugeM for surface and lapgaugeuM/lapgaugevM for velocity components
 at the surface.<br>
 A few additional settings may be added to the 
<pre>
     newrun -pre 'nf=3,5,7;case=a0.09;date=slope10;var=value' solrup
</pre>
as var=value. <br>
Some options are
<ul>
<li> eps=val  Truncation limit/amplitude for solitons (def 0.001 )
<li> f=val  Relative reduction of grid near beach (def 1)
<li> dxb=val Grid-increment at flat bottom  (def 0.5)
<li> sl=val smoothed region near kink in bottom profile (def 0.2)
<li> ng=val sets number of Gaussian points for each of the three (fixed) 
     subintervals in each panel. (def 6) 
<li> red=val reduction of time interval. Value 1 corresponds to a Courant numberequal to 1 for a typical spatial increment in deep water. (def 1) 
</ul>
These setting may modify the path for the datafiles. For more complete list
  of actual parameters used see file geninp.par in the datafolder.
  this file is written by <a href="../scripdoc/geninp.txt"> geninp.pe </a>
  which is the perl script invoking the soliton program and the BIM solver.
 For higher amplitudes, or gentler slopes, a thinner swash tongue is generated.
  Then extra accuracy in the integration and a smaller time step may be required. On the other hand, a small f parameter may be harmful. For an amplitude of
  0.3 on a 10 deg slope a recommended command may be something like  
<pre>
     newrun -pre 'nf=3,5,7;case=a0.30;date=slope10;ng=10;f=1;red=0.2' solrup
</pre>
The important thing is that three subsequent resolutions yield consistent
results.
<li> Postprocessing.<br>
   Some postprocessing is included in the simulation snippets. This includes
   <ul>
    <li> Extraction and formatting of time series at gauge positions.
    <li> From November 10th 2010: formatting of the shoreline motion.
         Otherwise this formatting may be performed by, for instance
  <pre>
     /hom/geirkp/lab/Erika/lapbeach.sh  -case 10 -date 20101018 -ddir solrupcase102010101810.0/a0.0974597/quad6one6GF8/nf7red1_6_3f0.4
     /hom/geirkp/lab/Erika/boussbeach.sh  -case 10 -date 20101018 -ddir boussrup1020101018Blokkreg/n1200
  </pre>
     when in the project folder. The result will be a file Shoreser.dat.
   </ul>
</ol>
   <p>
<h3>The data-files</h3>
 Unless otherwise is specified all data are dimensionless with the depth, d, as 
 length scale and sqrt(d/g) as time scale. The times are synchronized with 
the laboratory time line. 
<ol>
<li> Maximum runup<br>
     The file param.dat contains input, as well as a few output, parameters.
     For Boussinesq simulations the parameter  R1 in param.dat is the value of R/A for the first runup. For the BIM simulations the corresponding parameter, R1, is found in the file runres.dat.
<li> Time series for the surface at gauge positions.<br>
     These are given as two column files: time vertical-coordinate. When 
     compared to flow depth measurements the vertical position of the beach 
     must be subtracted from the numerical series. Still a small eror may 
     remain due to the angle of the accoustic probe. Files
     <ul>
     <li> Boussinesq: Seta'M'contains the time series of surface elevation 
          for gauge with number -M+1.
     <li> BIM: lapgaugeM contains the time series of surface elevation 
          for gauge with number M.
     </ul>    
  <li> Shoreline motion.<br>
      For both Boussinesq and BIM the file Shoreser.dat is a 4 column file
      with t x s y, where t is (lab) time, and x, s and are positions horizontally, 
      along beach and vertically, respectively. All of x, s and y are zero 
      at the equilibrium shoreline and are positive during runup.    
</ol>

<h3>Boundary layer computations</h3>
<ol>
<li> The computation of boundary layers requires special computations with time series in 
     a specific "block" form. Commands may run like
<pre>
newrun -pre 'case=a0.09;date=slope10;nf=7;skipgauge=yes;npunkt=400;red=0.2' solrup
newrun -pre 'n=1200;case=a0.09;date=slope10;npunkt=400;skipgauge=yes' boussrup
</pre>
As compared to the invocations of the solrup and boussrup snippets above, two new 
features have been added. First 'skipgauge=yes' which suppresses the automatic writing
of time series at the gauge locations. Secondly, the 'npunkt=400' setting turn the
output mode for time series to a block form (the BIM model always uses block form) giving a 400 x (number of timesteps+1) <a href="../gpxyconv/index.html" > gphov </a>files with 400 points along the beach. The span covered is specified by <p>
<ol>
<li>blim=a,b are given in the command line. With the shoreline at zero, this yield the interva a:b, where a positive value in onshore.
<li>
Parameters Eserlim$case and Eserbeach$case are read from 
  /hom/geirkp/lab/knekkstrand/Misc.par, if that file do exist and do contain
  the parameters. The value of the parameters are given according to the 
  Lagrangian Boussinsq model with the equilibrium shoreline at zero and 
  onshore values as negative. (opposite to above point) 
<li> Synolaki's formula is used to estimate maximum inundation:xs. Then
     the interval  -0.2*xs:xs is used. 
</ol><p>
 The last option is recommended. 
 The setting red=0.2 causes a smaller time step in the BIM model, giving 
a denser temporal output. This may be an advantage for boundary layer simulations.  <br>
The above 'solrup' and 'boussrup' applications yield the folders
<pre>
solrupcasea0.09slope10Blokk40010.0
boussrupa0.09slope10Blokk400reg
<pre>
with subfolder structures as given above.
<li> For BIM the tangential velocity at the bottom, in file ESusb, are used for boundary 
layer computations. For the Boussinesq model the horizontal, average velocities in ESu
are used. The difference between averaged and bottom velocities, as well as that between
horizontal and along-bottom components, is of minor importance.
<li> The Boundary layers are computed by a separate fortran <a href="../bounlay/index.html">program</a>.   This program is invoked by commands like
<pre>
newrun -pre 'red=0.2;case=a0.09;date=slope10;nz=200;nx=400;mode=nonlin;nf=3;trac=stop' Lblayer
newrun -pre 'red=0.2;case=a0.09;date=slope10;nz=200;nx=400;mode=lin;nf=7;trac=stop' Lblayer
newrun -pre 'spes=red0.2_6_3f0.4;case=a0.09;date=slope10;nz=200;nx=400;mode=lin;n=7;trac=stop' Lblayer
newrun -pre 'case=a0.09;date=slope10;nz=200;nx=400;mode=nonlin;n=1200;trac=stop' Mblayer
</pre>
Lblayer is for the BIM model, Mblayer for the Boussinesq model. The parameters are
<ul>
<li> nf or n - resolution, corresponds to nf in the solrup and n in the boussrup snippets.
<li> red, case, nx - as in  the solrup or the boussrup snippets.
<li> if "spes" is given it is used as the last part of the path (after nf$nf).
<li> mode - selects either linear or nonlinear boundary value theory
<li> nz - number of points normal to beach 
<li> nper (optional) - number of time steps between outputs (time step is as in 
     BIM or Boussinesq model). Default give output of velocity fields which is
     synchronous with BIM/Boussinesq simulation.
<li> trac -- the special value stop prevents integration of quantities along a 
     a particle trace. Tracing cannot be performed until some special preparations are made.
</ul>
Lists separated by commas are accepted for mode, nx, nz and n.
The Mblayer and Lblayer snippets will generate subfolders under the simulation folder
named blaynonlin200, blaylin200 where the number corresponds to nz.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Obtaining velocity fields from the BIM model</h3>
First more output must be produced than by the preceding invocations of solrup.
<pre>
newrun -pre 'case=a0.09;date=slope10;nf=2;skipgauge=yes;mapr=yes' solrup
</pre>
The setting of the last flag leads to more output; accelerations and 
also the set* and solv* files needed for the computations in <a href="../scripdoc/felt.txt"> felt.sh </a>. <p>
For computation of the fields the velfields snippet is used
<pre>
newrun -pre 'case=a0.09;date=slope10;nf=2;cord=org;n=1;origo=10,-1;grid=30,15;res=0.5,0.1' velfields
newrun -pre 'case=a0.09;date=slope10;nf=2;cord=shore;n=80;origo=0,0;grid=60,60;res=0.025,0.005;' velfields
</pre>
For this case the upper command actually computes the initial condition (nearly), while the lower shows the swash zone. The data are put in the subdirectory specified by gdir (default: vels). Parameters are set according to
<ul>
<li>case, date and nf as explained above. There are no defaults for case and date, whereas nf is 
    default set to 7.
<li>cord=arg: sets coordinate system. There are three different values of arg
  <ol>
  <li> org  -- the coordinate system of the BIM simulation is used. The origin is then at the end with no beach.
<li> shore -- the origin is put in the equilibrium shoreline, but the axes are still horizontal and vertical.
 <li> beach --  the origin is put in the equilibrium shoreline and the axes are along the beach and normal to the beach, respectively.
  </ol>
<li> n=arg: the list of times to be computed (separated with ,). Default: arg=10,20,30
<li> origo=arg;grid=arg;res=arg : contain duplets (comma separated), correponding to lower left corner, number of points and increments, respectively, for the grid at which velocities etc. are computed.
<li>nh=arg;mh=arg: Set number of Gaussian points and subintervals in each panel. For a thin swash tongue
     nh may be chosen large (12, for instance). Default values: 6 and 2.  
<li>spes=arg: sets the last part of the data-path. Default:red1_6_3f0.4
<li>gdir=arg: sets the subdirectory in which the essential files from the BIM simulation are copied 
(and transformed if necessary). Default: vels
<li>felter=arg: This is for testing. Keep away!
</ul>
