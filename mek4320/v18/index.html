This page reviews some key information on the course and should not be
confused with the 
<a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MEK4320/v18/"> the official home page </a>.

<p> <h3> The exam </h3> <p>
     The date is June 6th.<br>
     <a href="explan.html"> Schedule (times for individual questioning) </a>

<p> <h3> Semester plan </h3> <p>
<a href="plan.html"> Schedule for classes; </a> Weeks that are marked by an 
  asterix may still be modified.
<p> <h3> Compulsory assignments. </h3> <p>
<h4> Assignment 1</h4>
<a href="obl1.pdf"> Two problems on properties of the linear wave mode.</a><br>
The deadline is February 22 at 12.15. Preferably the paper should be delivered in class that day. Alternatives are submission of an electronic version by email, or  deliverance of a hard copy in the post shelf of G. Pedersen at the Departments office at Ullev√•l stadium. The assignment may be handwritten or type-set, according to your own choice.

<h4> Assignment 2</h4>
In the assignment we utilize a simple <a href="../../bouss/index.html">Boussinesq model.</a> A description with examples are given in the page linked below. While it
is possible to compile the code it is recommended to copy the "sbouss" 
executable which should run on all 64 bit Linux implementations. 
<ul>
<li><a href="../../bouss/index.html">The Boussinesq model.</a>
<li> <a href="../../bouss/eq.pdf"> A short treatise on the model. </a>
<li><a href="../../bouss/exercises.pdf"> Problems related to the model.</a> 
</ul>   
You are required to do <a href="../../bouss/exercises.pdf"> problems 2-6 </a>.
This is, essentially, a series of simulations for which you must assess the
results and relate them to each other and to subjects from the syllabus.
If you organize your work in a structured manner, making the simulations
should not be too time consuming. <br>
The students will work in groups. Each group will do all parts of the assignment. It is also important that all students within each group make themselves familiar with all the problems, as some of these will be the basis for  questions at the final exam. <br>
The deadline is 19/4. A few days prior to this deadline each group will be given a part of the assignment, which they will present in class at this day. The presentation, and ensuing discussion, will be assessed. There is no submission of any written report or program snippets.  
<p> 
<p> <h3>Syllabus.</h3> <p>
The syllabus is mainly be taken from the Lecture Notes
Mek 4320:
Hydrodynamic Wave theory.<br>
<a href="kompendium.pdf"> Mostly english version.*</a><a href="correV18.pdf"> List of corrections.</a><br>
*:The translation to english is incomplete and revisions are being made. <br>
<a href="kompendiumJan17.pdf"> Compendium as of January 2017. Used in the start of the spring 2018.</a><br>
There is an older
Norwegian <a href="kompendium07mek4320.pdf"> Norwegian version.</a> which is obsolescent.<br>
. 
<ul>
<li> Whenever slides are provided on a theme they take presedence over 
     corresponding parts of the compendium. In some parts the compendium is
     imprecise or erratic. More information will be given later </a>.
Sections from the compendium: 
  <ul>
    <li>1, 2.1-2.3, 
    <li>2.4.  Different presentation in slides.
    <li> 2.5-2.9; except the Fresnel integrals on pages 37 and 38 and
         error analysis on page 42, bottom, and page 43, top.
    <li> 2.10-2.11. There are alos slides for these sections.
    <li> 2.13
    <li> 3, but with slides replacing the derivation of the WKBJ methods.
           Also  extra examples are given on the slides (given below).
    <li> 4.1 and 4.3, but not 4.2.
    <li>5 and 6 are not part of the syllabus. However, the Kelvin ship wave pattern is included as an example of ray theory.
    <li> 7.  7.2 is complemented by slides. These also cover 7.2.1 which exempted from the syllabus.
    <li> Stokes waves. This topic is only covered by slides.  
</ul>
 <li> Complementary material: 
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="enEng.pdf"> Slides on energy in surface waves </a> Replaces page 22 and 23 in the compendium.
    <li> <a href="frontbem.pdf"> Slides on energy on evolution of wave front. </a> Similar to the compendium.
    <li> <a href="kgbem.pdf"> Slides on stationary phase and the K.G. equation. </a>
<ul>
