 <h1>Notes on MEK4320, spring 2019</h1>
<p><hr> 
This page reviews some key information on the course and should not be
confused with the 
<a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MEK4320/v19/"> the official home page </a>.

<p> <h3> The exam </h3> <p>
   <a href="explan.html"> Schedule. </a> 
     
<p> <h3> Student representative </h3> <p>
Christopher Lawrence,  chrislaw     at  math.uio.no.


<p> <h3> Semester plan </h3> <p>
<a href="plan.html"> Schedule for classes; </a> Weeks that are marked by an 
  asterix may still be modified.
<p> <h3> Compulsory assignments. </h3> <p>
     <h4> Assignment 1</h4>
  <a href="obl1.pdf"> Two problems on properties of the linear wave mode.</a><br>
This assignment makes you probe further into the shallow/deep water issues and the validity of linearization for gravity waves.<br>   
Deadline and way of submission are still to be decided.<p>

<h4> Assignment 2</h4>
 In the assignment we utilize a simple <a href="../../bouss/index.html">Boussinesq model.</a> A description with examples are given in the page linked below. While it
is possible to compile the code it is recommended to copy the "sbouss" 
executable which should run on all 64 bit Linux implementations. 
<ul>
<li><a href="../../bouss/index.html">The Boussinesq model.</a>
<li> <a href="../../bouss/eq.pdf"> A short treatise on the model. </a>
<li><a href="../../bouss/exercises.pdf"> Problems related to the model.</a> 
</ul>   
You are required to do <a href="../../bouss/exercises.pdf"> problems 2-6 </a>.
This is, essentially, a series of simulations for which you must assess the
results and relate them to each other and to subjects from the syllabus.
If you organize your work in a structured manner, making the simulations
should not be too time consuming. <br>
The students will work in groups. Each group will do all parts of the assignment. It is also important that all students within each group make themselves familiar with all the problems, as some of these will be the basis for  questions at the final exam. <br>
The day for the presentation is 6/5. A few days prior to this deadline each group will be given a part of the assignment, which they will present in class at this day. The presentation, and ensuing discussion, will be assessed. There is no submission of any written report or program snippets for the students that do presentations.  
 <p>
   
 <p> <h3>Student presentations.</h3> <p>
     Examples on the use of the FFT technique on selected problems  by Christopher Lawrence.
     <ul>
     <li><a href="SWE_with_Pseudo_Spectral_Method.pptx"> A ppt presentation. </a>
     <li><a href="LSWE.gif"> Animation of a LSW solution <a> </li>
     <li><a href="HOSM.gif"> Animation of a linear solution of potential theory. <a></li>

     </ul>
		       

 <p> <h3>Final syllabus.</h3> <p>
     
The syllabus is mainly be taken from the Lecture Notes
Mek 4320:
Hydrodynamic Wave theory.<br>
<a href="kompendium.pdf"> Mostly english version.*</a><br>
*:The translation to english is incomplete and revisions are still being made. <br>
 
<ul>
<li> Whenever slides are provided on a theme they take presedence over 
     corresponding parts of the compendium. In some parts the compendium is
     imprecise or erratic. More information will be given later </a>.
Sections from the compendium: 
  <ul>
    <li>1, 2.1-2.3, 
    <li>2.4.  Different presentation in slides.
    <li> 2.5-2.9; except the Fresnel integrals on pages 37 and 38 and
         error analysis on page 42, bottom, and page 43, top.
    <li> 2.10-2.11. There are alos slides for these sections.
    <li> 2.13
    <li> 3, but with slides replacing the derivation of the WKBJ methods.
           Also  extra examples are given on the slides (given below).
    <li> 4.1 and 4.3, but not 4.2.
    <li>5 and 6 are not part of the syllabus. However, the Kelvin ship wave pattern is included as an example of ray theory.
    <li> 7.  7.2 is complemented by slides. These also cover 7.2.1 which exempted from the syllabus.
    <li> Stokes waves. This topic is only covered by slides.  
</ul>
 <li> Complementary material: 
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="enEng.pdf"> Slides on energy in surface waves </a> Replaces page 22 and 23 in the compendium.
    <li> <a href="frontbem.pdf"> Slides on evolution of wave front. </a> Similar to the compendium.
    <li> <a href="kgbem.pdf"> Slides on stationary phase and the K.G. equation. </a>
