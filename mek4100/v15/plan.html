<td>We revisit, briefly, problem 4b. <br>
Problems 5 and  6 from leaflet. <br>
Problem 13 from the leaflet will be part of first mandatory assignment.
We will not solve this problem, but discuss as to how to go about it and 
what to expect. The first three terms should be worked out for all the 
solutions. <br>
Logan: Problem 9 page 166, problem 12 page 167, but stop at order epsilon. 
Extra question: compare the maximum height from the perturbation solution
to the exact value, which you can find from energy arguments.

<td> We present the method of Poincare Lindstedt for the non-linear eigenvalue
problem corresponding to free oscillations of a pendulum. We also scrutinize the
"failure" of the straightforward perturbation scheme for this problem. 
We then present another application of the P. L. method. </td>

a Taylor series expansion in t (around t=0), as well as solving the ODE numerically by
means of, for instance, Matlab or Python. <br>
