  asterix may still be modified.

<h4> Assignment 1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 10 (do not look up "Jacobi iteration" in the literature) from leaflet.
  <li>From Logan: Problem 9 page 166, problem 12 page 167, but stop at order epsilon. Extra question for students with some background in mechanics: compare the maximum height from the perturbation solution to the exact value, which you can find from energy arguments.
    </ul>
The deadline is  Thursday 17/9.
<p>
<h4> Assignment 2</h4>
From leaflet: the problems 22,  27c and 30.<br>

apart from those. <p>

<p> <h3>Additional literature.</h3> <p>
In general use of alternative or additional literature is not recommended.
The exception is elementary text books in calculus that some may need to
refresh basic knowledge; on Taylor series and ODEs in particular.
You should then use the ones you know from your introducton courses.
<p>
If you need to consult some book on a specific issue, these are suggested
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387989310">Advanced Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers I</a> by  Bender and Orszag. 
<li><a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319327259">Scaling of Differential Equations</a> by Langtangen and Pedersen. <br>
This is a book on scaling with a slightly different perspective from the one
in MEK4100. It contains a lot of examples on scaled problems and equations and 
are published with free access.
