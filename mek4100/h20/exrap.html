  <h2> The scores on sub-problems </h2>
  The results given below are based on a preliminary assessment,
  not the final one. The table contains the total score for all candidates.
  For problem 2c the score is split in two. (i) is the the score for transformation of the problem and the treatment of the lowest order. (ii) is for the treatment of the next order.

Comments
<ul>
  <li> Points 1 2a and 2c(i) were generally well answered.
  <li>The overall score on Point 2c(ii) corresponds to E. Problem 2e is identical to problem 22 in the leaflet and is a very basic two scale problem. In view of this the score on 2c(ii) is disappointing.
  <li> Problem 3 is a rather simple problem on Hamiltonian mechanics. The candidate were not well prepared on this topic.
    <li> Problem 4 has the lowest score. This is not surprising or alarming. However, after differentiation the problem becomes a special case of problem 8 from the leaflet.
