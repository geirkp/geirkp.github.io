 <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
 <h1>A program for the standard Boussinesq equation</h1>
 The program is written in Fortran (compatible with f77) and
 computes the evolution of initial value problems according to the
 standard Boussinesq equations. The initial conditions are either
read from file(s) or specified as solitary waves. The bottom is either 
flat or read from file. At the lateral boundaries no-flux conditions 
are employed. The numerical algorithm is based on finite differences on
a regular grid. All input and output is scaled by a single length (should
preferably be a typical depth). Velocity and time scales based on this 
length and the acceleration of gravity. Grid values are obtained from
the input files (depth, initial conditions) by linear interpolation.
Hence for coarse resolutions the input may deviate somewhat from the
actual fields used in the program.
<p>
The code is documented, to some extent anyhow, below and in the source files.
File names are referred to either with full path or the implicit path XXX,
 meaning that a file i386/sbouss in fact is XXX/i386/sbouss. At present
XXX is /mn/anatu/ansatte-u1/geirkp/www_docs/bouss, which is also
available at http://folk.uio.no/geirkp/bouss.

<h3>Running the program</h3>
The program is started by 
<pre>
XXX/i386/sbouss 
</pre>
and input is specified in a dialog. A certain degree of type check is performed on the answers,
default values are generally provided (given within /../)
and every input line starting with a '!' is discarded as a comment. In case of 
an illegal answer the question is rephrased and a new input line is read. 
The input is requested and provided by the user as described below.<p>
The best way to run a program like this is to produce an input file
and redirect the standard input of the program 
<pre>
XXX/i386/sbouss < indat 
</pre>
where indat is the name of the input file. Such an input file may be edited
from one of the examples or by cut and paste from an interactive run of
the program. Questions and comments may be included in the input file if 
preceded by '!'.<br>
The program may also be <a href="i386/sbouss"> downloaded </a> to a 64 bit Linux computer and made an executable by "chmod +x sbouss". Then the path to where it
 is copied must be used instead of "XXX/i386" in the examples above. 
<h4>Geometry</h4>
 First question
<pre>
give bathymetry option/readfromfile/
...
</pre>
where the dots represent the input from the user. 
Legal answers are readfromfile (default) and flat, as well as abbreviations of
these. In the first case the program prompts for a file name  
<pre>
give depthfile/depth.dat/
...
</pre>
otherwise a uniform depth equal to 1, starting at x=0, is assumed and
the length must be given
<pre>
give total length/100.0/
...
</pre>
A depth-file must contain two columns, x and depth, where
the x values may be non-equidistant, but must be given in increasing order. 
Then, the x-range corresponds to the last and first coordinate in the file.<br>
Next the number of grid points is specified by answering
<pre>
Give number of grid points/../
...
</pre>
A too large number of point will give an error message and the program stops

<h4>Equation/method settings</h4>
The type of equations is specified by answering
<pre>
give equation type/LSW/
...
</pre>
by one of 
<ul> <li>LSW  -- Linear shallow water equations
<li> NLSW  -- Nonlinear shallow water equation
<li>  LBoussinesq -- Linearized Boussinesq equations (contain dispersion)
<li> Boussinesq -- Weakly dispersive and nonlinear Boussinesq equations
</ul>
Again unique abbreviations are accepted and there is no case-sensitivity.
A numeric correction term is activated by answering yes  to
<pre>
Employ discrete correction term/yes/
...
</pre>

<h4>Selection of wave input</h4>
First the type of initial/boundary condition is selected
<pre>
give initial condition/readfromfile/
...
</pre>
where the answers may be 
<ul>
<li>soliton <br>
  The program asks for parameters for a solitary wave and computes an
  initial condition.
<li>readfromfile<br>
 The initial conditions are read from files
<li>boundary-conditions<br>
Input is specified at the left boundary. Files for the velocity and 
derivative of surface elevation with respect to x must be provided. 
<li>combined<br>
Initial conditions and boundary conditions are both read from files.
</ul>
Boundary files are explained below, but not yet functional. 

<h4> Setting of initial conditions</h4>
In case of initial conditions from file the user is prompted for
the names of two-column files for (x, surface elevation) and
(x, velocity).
 <pre>
give eta-data/eta.in/
..answer with name of surface file
 give u1-data
..answer with name of velocity file or type stop
</pre>
If the latter question is answered with stop, no file for velocities is read
and the motion is assumed to start from rest. Again the input files must 
contain coordinates in increasing order. However, they need not be equidistant
and eta and u file may contain  different coordinate values. Outside
the coordinate ranges covered by the input files zero is assumed.<br>
If soliton is chosen amplitude/depth, initial position and direction is
read
<pre>
give a/h/0.2/
...
give initial position/.../
...
Prop. toward decreasing x/yes/
...
</pre>

<h4>Time stepping/output</h4>
The time integration is divided into a number of periods (cycles) that
each correspond to an integer number of time steps. 
<pre>
Number of cycles/0/
...
give time interval/1/
... 
</pre>
After each period, or cycle, we may have the fields (velocity and surface
elevation) printed to file, according to the instructions below concerning printing.
<pre>
give reduction factor for dt/dx
...
</pre>
The reduction factor, f, sets the maximum allowable time step to
f*dx/sqrt(max depth). The program then finds the largest time step, smaller
than this, that correspond to an integer fraction of the period.
When the NLSW equation is solved f should be less than 1/(1+1.5*amp/depth),
where amp is the amplitude (height) of the wave.<p>
If a negative time interval is given, the program instead requests a
time increment and the number of increments in a period.<br>
<pre>
give timestep
...
give number of time steps in interval directly
...
</pre>
<pre>
times for printing/all/
...
</pre>
The point of the questions on printing is to enable a dense temporal output
in selected stages of the development. 
Times for printing are given as separate numbers, as dense intervals (n:m)
or intervals with an increment (n:m;i). If the total number of periods is
15 the input
<pre>
1 4 8:14;2
</pre>
will give output after periods 1, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14. The input all will
give output after every interval. The initial values are always printed.
 
<h4> Reading of boundary conditions </h4>
If boundary input is chosen, either alone or together with initial conditions,
two files must be available. The names are read according to
<pre>
give u boundary file
..answer with name of file
give ex boundary file
..answer with name of file for the x derivative of the surface elevation
<pre>
Both files are ascii files with time and value as columns. The temporal
distribution does not need to be neither the same nor uniform for the files.
Outside the range of the files, both the velocity and the surface derivative
are assumed zero.

<a name="examples"></a>
<h3>Examples</h3>
Examples, with input files (named indat) and output, are found in sub-folders
in the  the folder XXX/examples. The folder examples_dry contains sub-folders 
with input files to the program, only, and no results files.
In some of the examples the grid is somewhat coarse. The examples
may be copied from the tar archive <a href="cases.tar"> cases.tar </a>, which is inflated by "tar -xz < cases.tar". Available
examples in sub-folders are 

<h4>  flat </h4>
      A solitary wave propagating to the right in constant depth.
      The initial position is a little too close to the left hand
      boundary, with a little local noise as a consequence.

<h4>  shoaling/nYY</h4>  
      An solitary wave incident on a slope and a shelf is eventually
      split into a series of solitary waves in shallow water. YY is the number of grid nodes. A larger YY thus yields a finer resolution.  
<h4>  initial  </h4>
       Initial value problem where both surface elevations and velocities
        are specified. Also the depth is read from file.


<a name="compilation"></a>
<h3>File structure and compilation (Obsolete)</h3>
The main program and routines for discrete Boussinesq equations is found in
XXX/bouss.f. A number of extra routines are called. Routines for dialog and 
input/output are found in the archive XXX/dia/dia.a, while general purpose 
routines are in XXX/bibl/bibl.a. The FORTRAN code is found in XXX/dia/*.f and
XXX/bibl/*.f, but is less well documented. Compilation of the program 
takes place in XXX/i386 by means of the file mbouss. The following
lines of shell code will do the complete compilation
<pre>
cd XXX
cd bibl; ./buildlib.sh
cd ../dia; ./buildlib.sh 
cd ../i386; make -f mbouss
</pre>  

<a name="program"></a>
<h3>About the program and the numerics</h3>
<h4>Output</h4>
The program produces the following output files
<ul>
<li> etaN,  where N is an integer corresponding to the time period (cycle).
     This is a column files
<li> uN,  velocities. Observe that uN is output 0.5*dt later than etaN. 
<li> In case of boundary input: urnd, exrnd contain the boundary values 
     as invoked in the program (after interpolation from the input) 
<li> h, the depth in eta nodes
<li> The programs part of the dialog is written on the standard error stream.
<ul>
 <h4>Numerics, software</h4>
A few of the key routines are briefly defined in the table below.
 Those not associated with the solution of the PDEs should be regarded as black
boxes. A short description of mathematics and numerics is found in a
separate <a href="eq.pdf">pdf </a> file.
